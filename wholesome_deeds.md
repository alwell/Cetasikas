## Wholesome Deeds


As we have seen, nineteen sobhana cetasikas accompany each sobhana
citta. In order to perform wholesome deeds the kusala citta needs the
assistance of at least these nineteen cetasikas. It needs confidence in
kusala, mindfulness which is non-forgetful of kusala, shame which
shrinks from akusala and fear of blame which fears its consequences.
Each kusala citta has to be rooted in the two beautiful roots, sobhana
hetus, of non-attachment, alobha, and non-aversion, adosa. Moreover,
there has to be equanimity or mental balance, there has to be calm of
cetasikas and calm of citta. There have to be the other “pairs” of
mental lightness, pliancy, workableness, proficiency and uprightness, so
that there is suppleness and proficiency in the performing of good
deeds[(206)](#FOOT206). In addition to the nineteen sobhana cetasikas
which accompany each sobhana citta, there are, as we have seen, six
other sobhana cetasikas which do not accompany each sobhana citta. These
are the three abstinences of right speech, right action and right
livelihood, compassion, sympathetic joy and understanding. Thus, there
are twentysix sobhana cetasikas in all. The three abstinences,
compassion and sympathetic joy arise when there is an opportunity for
them. Understanding does not accompany each sobhana citta, but for
mental development, which includes samatha and vipassanā, understanding
is indispensable. Each sobhana cetasika has its own function to perform
while it assists the kusala citta. Learning about these sobhana
cetasikas will help us to see that good qualities do not belong to a
self. It is not “I” who is generous, who has kindness or compassion,
they are sobhana cetasikas which assist the kusala citta.

We would like to have kusala citta more often but akusala cittas are
bound to arise so long as the latent tendencies to akusala have not been
eradicated. The eradication of defilements is the goal of the Buddha’s
teachings and this can be realized through the development of insight.
Right understanding should be developed together with all other good
qualities. The Buddha, when he was still a Bodhisatta, developed right
understanding together with all other kinds of wholesomeness, he
developed the wholesome qualities which are the “perfections”
(parāmis)[(207)](#FOOT207), during innumerable lives so that in his last
life he could attain Buddhahood. This reminds us not to neglect the
development of any kind of kusala for which there is an opportunity.

We have learnt about the twentyfive sobhana cetasikas, but now we should
apply our knowledge in daily life. When we learn more in detail about
the opportunities for the performing of good deeds there are conditions
for using such opportunities. Good deeds can be classified as generosity
(dāna), morality (sīla) and mental development (bhāvanā). The
*Atthasālinī* (I, Book I, Part IV, Chapter VIII, 157) gives, with regard
to kusala cittas of the sense-sphere, mahā-kusala cittas, a tenfold
classification of good deeds, namely as the “ten bases of meritorious
deeds” (puñña-kiriya-vatthus). Learning about these aspects is
beneficial for the practice of kusala. We read in the *Atthasālinī*
about the following “bases of meritorious deeds”:

1. charity or generosity
2. virtue or morality
3. culture or mental development
4. respect
5. dutifulness or helpfulness
6. sharing one’s merit
7. thanksgiving or appreciation of someone else’s good deeds
8. teaching Dhamma
9. listening to Dhamma
10. rectification of opinion (correction of one’s views)

As regards the first “base” or way of kusala, generosity, this is the
giving away of useful things or things which give pleasure. True
generosity is difficult; while we are giving, there are not kusala
cittas all the time, and our motives for giving may not all be pure.
Akusala cittas tend to arise in between the kusala cittas, for example,
when we wish for a pleasant result, such as a happy rebirth or a good
name. We may give because we like to be popular, or we may give with
attachment to the receiver. We may give out of fear, we are afraid of
other people’s opinion and hope to gain their favours by our gifts.
Stinginess may arise, we regret getting rid of our money. We understand
that we cannot take our possessions with us when we die, but since we
have accumulated stinginess it tends to arise. We should remember that
life is short and that when there is an opportunity for giving we should
use it in order to combat selfishness. In this way the inclination to
generosity can be accumulated. We read in the Commentary to the
“Cariyāpiṭaka” (the “Paramatthadīpanī VII)[(208)](#FOOT208), which deals
with the “perfections” the Bodhisatta accumulated, that the Bodhisatta
considered the perfection of generosity as follows:

> Surely, I have not been accustomed to giving in the past, therefore a
> desire to give does not arise now in my mind. So that my mind will
> delight in giving in the future, I will give a gift. With an eye for
> the future let me now relinquish what I have to those in need.

Further on we read in the same commentary:

> When the Great Being is giving a gift, and he sees the loss of the
> object being given, he reflects thus: “This is the nature of material
> possessions, that they are subject to loss and to passing away.
> Moreover, it is because I did not give such gifts in the past that my
> possessions are now depleted. Let me then give whatever I have as a
> gift, whether it be limited or abundant. In that way I will, in the
> future, reach the peak in the perfection of giving.”

The *Atthasālinī* explains in the section on “charity”, that there can
be volition (kamma) which is kusala before the actual giving, namely
when one produces the things to be given, at the time of making the
gift, and afterwards when one recollects it “with joyful heart”. Thus,
giving can be an occasion for kusala cittas in three different periods:
before, during and after the giving. It is useful to know that we can
recollect our giving afterwards with kusala citta. However, we have to
know the difference between kusala citta and akusala citta, otherwise we
are likely to take attachment to our kusala or to the pleasant feeling
which may arise for kusala. When we are honest with ourselves we can
notice that before, during and after the giving there are not kusala
cittas all the time, that there are also akusala cittas arising. Instead
of being discouraged about akusala there can be mindfulness of it. This
is the way to know that it is only a conditioned reality, not self.
Before the actual giving we may get tired when we have to buy or prepare
the gift and then aversion is likely to arise. While we are giving the
gift the receiver may be ungrateful and not respond to our gift in the
way we expected and then we may be disappointed. However, when we have
right understanding of what kusala is we will be less inclined to mind
the reactions of someone else. Kusala is kusala and nobody can change
the kusala citta which arises. Before we learnt about the Buddha’s
teachings we did not consider generosity in this way. We used to pay
attention merely to the outward appearance of deeds, we thought of
people, of their reactions. Through the Dhamma we learn to investigate
the cittas which motivate our deeds, we learn to see realities as they
are. Also the recollection of our generosity after the giving can be
disturbed by the arising of defilements such as stinginess. Generosity
can only become perfected through the development of right understanding
of nāma and rūpa. The sotāpanna (streamwinner) has eradicated the wrong
view of self and also stinginess. Thus, he has perfect generosity,
stinginess cannot arise again.

When we perform acts of generosity, the objects which can be given are
the objects which can be experienced through the six doors. The
*Atthasālinī* (I, Book I, Part II, 77) illustrates the giving of colour
with a story about the treasurer of King Duṭṭhagāmani who presented a
dress embroidered with gold at the great shrine, saying, “This dress is
golden in appearance, the Supreme Buddha is also golden in appearance;
the golden cloth suits the Golden One, and it will be our gift of
colour.” With the intention to make an offering of sound one can offer a
musical instrument such as a drum to the Triple Gem. With the intention
to make a gift of flavour one may offer, for example, a root with a
captivating flavour.

We read in the same section of the *Atthasālinī* that, when someone
makes the gift with his own hands it is an act through the body. When he
tells his relatives or friends to present his offering it is an act of
speech. When he is considering to make a gift it is an act of thought.
Afterwards he will do what is necessary by act or speech in order to
accomplish his intention.

The *Atthasālinī* (in the same section, 77) explains that, when someone
in giving gifts observes the tradition of his family or observes usage,
the giving is accomplished by sīla, morality. Observing rules of
tradition which are the foundation of wholesome conduct is sīla.

Even when one does not have things to give there can still be
accomplishment of generosity. Another one of the ten “bases” which is
also a way of generosity is the “base of thanksgiving” or rejoicing in
someone else’s kusala. In order to be able to apply ourselves to this
way of kusala we should understand the benefit of kusala. When we have
confidence ourselves in generosity, in the observance of morality and in
the development of insight, we can appreciate these ways of kusala in
someone else. We can appreciate the good qualities of someone else and
express our appreciation in words so that others may also rejoice in
such qualities. When we appreciate someone else’s kusala there is
generosity, envy does not arise at such moments. When we know about this
way of generosity we may remember to speak with kusala citta about the
good qualities of other people instead of saying unpleasant things about
them.

There is still another way of generosity and this is the “base” which is
the “sharing of one’s merit”. We cannot transfer to others the kusala we
perform nor the result it will produce; each person receives the results
of his own good deeds. However, we can by performing good deeds be a
condition for other people to have kusala cittas as well, namely, when
they rejoice in our good deeds. In this way we can “share merit” with
others, even with beings in other planes of existence, provided they are
in planes where they are able to receive this benefit.

The commentary to the “Without the Walls” sutta (the “Illustrator of
Ultimate Meaning”, paramatthajotikā, commentary to the “Minor Readings”,
Khuddakapāṭha) narrates that King Bimbisāra offered a meal to the Buddha
and omitted to dedicate his gift to other beings. Ghosts who were his
relatives in a former life had hoped for this in vain and because of
disappointment and despair they made a horrible screeching in the night.
The Buddha explained why the ghosts had screeched. Then King Bimbisāra
made again an offering and did not omit to make the dedication, “Let
this be for those relatives”. The ghosts benefited from his gifts
immediately, they had kusala cittas and their suffering was allayed.
Lotus-covered pools were generated for them in which they could bathe
and drink, and they took on the colour of gold. Moreover, heavenly food,
heavenly clothing and heavenly palaces were generated for them. This
story illustrates that one can share one’s merit with beings who are
departed. If one’s departed relatives are not able to receive this
benefit other beings can. The sutta which has been explained in the
commentary ends with the following words:

 ``` 
 Give gifts then for departed ones, 
 Recalling what they used to do. 
 No weeping nor yet sorrowing, 
 Nor any kind of mourning, aids 
 Departed Ones, whose kin remain 
 (Unhelpful to them, acting) thus. 
 But when this offering is given 
 Well placed in the Community 
 For them, then it can serve them long 
 In future and at once as well. 
 
 The true Idea(209) for relatives has 
 thus been shown, 
 And how high honour to departed ones 
 is done, 
 And how the bhikkhus can be given strength as well, 
 And how great merit can be stored away by you.
 
 ``` 
It is understandable that we are sad when we lose beloved ones, but if
we know how to develop what is wholesome it can be a great consolation.
Instead of sadness and aversion there can be kusala citta when we
dedicate our good deeds to all those who are able to rejoice in it. It
can become our custom to share wholesomeness with others.

It is a Buddhist custom when a meal or robes are offered to the monks to
pour water over one’s hands while the monks recite words of blessing, in
order to give expression to one’s intention to dedicate this deed to
other beings. The water is like a river which fills the ocean and even
so a wholesome deed is so plentiful that it can be shared with others.

Some of the “ten bases of meritorious deeds” are included in morality,
sīla. Abstinence from ill deeds is sīla. There is abstinence from
akusala kamma through the body and this is abstinence from killing,
stealing and sexual misconduct. There is abstinence from akusala kamma
through speech and this is abstinence from lying, slandering, rude
speech and idle talk. When we commit wrong deeds for the sake of our
livelihood, there is wrong livelihood. When we abstain from wrong
livelihood there is right livelihood. As we have seen (in chapter 32),
the three sobhana cetasikas which are abstinence from wrong speech,
abstinence from wrong action and abstinence from wrong livelihood
perform their functions in assisting the kusala citta while there is an
occasion for abstaining from evil conduct. Sīla is not only abstaining
from what should not be done, it is also observing what should be done.
We can observe moral precepts which are the foundation of wholesome
conduct. A layman can make a resolution to observe them. He makes the
resolution to undertake the rule of training to abstain from the
following unwholesome deeds:

- killing living beings
- stealing
- sexual misbehaviour
- lying
- the taking of intoxicants such as alcoholic drinks

It is a Buddhist custom for laypeople to recite the five precepts when
they are assembled in a temple on special occasions. When one recites
them with a sincere inclination there is an opportunity for
wholesomeness. Conditions are accumulated for wholesome conduct, for
observing the precepts also when one is in difficult circumstances which
make it hard to observe them. Morality can be considered also under the
aspect of generosity, as a form of giving, because when we give up
defilements it is also for the benefit and happiness of other beings; we
let them live in safety and in peace. When we abstain from killing we
give the gift of life. When we see morality as a gift of kindness to
others and as a way to have less selfishness we can be inspired to
observe it.

As regards abstinence from slandering, rude speech and idle talk, these
are not among the five precepts for laypeople. However, engaging in
these kinds of speech is akusala, whereas abstaining from them is kusala
kamma. We are inclined to be heedless with regard to abstinence from
wrong speech. When others speak in an unpleasant way about people we may
find it hard not to join in the conversation. Or we may find abstinence
of useless, idle talk a way of morality which is hard to observe. So
long as one is not an arahat there are still opportunities for speaking
with akusala citta. In the development of wholesomeness one has to be
farsighted. We should realize that what we accumulate today,
wholesomeness or unwholesomeness, can have its effects in the future,
even in future lives. We can become more clever in evaluating the
circumstances we are in, and the friends we have: we will be able to
judge whether surroundings and friends are favourable for the
development of wholesomeness or not. We will know what kind of speech
should be avoided, what kind of speech is helpful. Since we will be
engaged in conversation with others anyway we should learn how we can
turn the conversation into an opportunity for wholesomeness. We may
remember the way of generosity which is appreciation of other people’s
kusala while we speak. Or when the conversation tends to be idle talk
about pleasant objects, such as good food, nice weather or journeys,
there is an opportunity for sympathetic joy. We can rejoice in other
people’s good fortune of receiving pleasant objects. We should, however,
know when the citta is kusala citta and when akusala citta. Otherwise we
may erroneously think that there is the sobhana cetasika of sympathetic
joy when there is actually attachment.

The *Visuddhimagga* (Chapter I) deals with many aspects of sīla. For the
monks there is the observance of the rules of the Order of monks
(Paṭimokkha). It is difficult to observe morality perfectly for a
layman; he may find himself in circumstances where it is hard not to
neglect morality. He may be tempted to kill insects in house and garden,
to evade taxes or to accept bribes. The person who has accumulated
inclinations for monkhood leaves his home for the homeless life in order
to observe morality perfectly and to lead a life of non-violence and of
contentment with little. The monk should not delight in gain and honour.
He should not give hints nor use other means of scheming in order to
obtain the requisites of robes, food, dwelling and medicines, and this
is training in livelihood purification, which is an aspect of sīla
mentioned in the *Visuddhimagga*. Another aspect of sīla is reflecting
wisely on the use of the requisites. The monk should train himself not
to be attached to the requisites but he should know that they are not
for pleasure, that they are to be used for his health and comfort. Thus,
he can dedicate himself to the study and teaching of Dhamma and the
development of right understanding. Also laypeople can reflect wisely,
for example, on food, while they are eating. Food is most of the time an
object of attachment and it can also be an object of aversion. There may
be moments that we reflect wisely, with kusala citta, on the use of
food: food can be considered as a medicine for the body. Then we will be
less inclined to indulge in food. Overeating leads to laziness.

Another aspect of sīla mentioned by the *Visuddhimagga* (I, 42 B) is
“virtue of restraint of the sense faculties”. We read in this section a
quotation from the “Middle Length Sayings” I, 27, the “Lesser Discourse
on the Simile of the Elephant’s Footprint”. The text states:

> …On seeing a visible object with the eye, he apprehends neither the
> signs nor the particulars through which, if he left the eye faculty
> unguarded, evil and unprofitable states of covetousness and grief
> might invade him, he enters upon the way of its restraint, he guards
> the eye faculty, undertakes the restraint of the eye faculty…

The same is said of the other doors. When mindfulness arises of one
reality at a time as it presents itself through one of the six doors,
sīla, good moral conduct, is observed. Moreover, the understanding is
being developed which can eradicate defilements. If one separates the
observance of sīla from the development of insight sīla cannot become
enduring. If one does not develop insight defilements can be temporarily
subdued but not eradicated.

Through the development of right understanding sīla can become more
perfected. As we have seen, the three cetasikas which are the
“abstinences” arise only one at a time when they accompany kusala citta
which is not lokuttara but lokiya, “mundane”. When enlightenment is
attained all three of them accompany the lokuttara citta. At the moment
of the path-consciousness, magga-citta, there is “abstinence by way of
eradication”; that is the function of the three factors of right speech,
right action and right livelihood of the eightfold Path which is
lokuttara. Tendencies to evil conduct are eradicated at the subsequent
stages of enlightenment, until they are all eradicated at the attainment
of arahatship.

The paying of respect to those who deserve respect is another one of the
“bases of meritorious deeds” and this is included in sīla. Respect is
due to monks, novices, parents, teachers and elderly people. We can
express respect and politeness through our conduct in body and speech.
We may have selfish motives when we are polite, for example, when we
wish for a good reputation or when we want to obtain favours. That is
not the way of kusala which is respect. We can pay respect with kusala
citta, and then respect is sincere. We should pay respect to the monks
because they have left their homes for the homeless life in order to
strive after the virtues of the ariyans. The goal of monkhood is
arahatship and, thus, the monks can remind us of the virtues of the
ariyan Sangha, even if they are not arahats. Laypeople can pay respect
to monks by clasping their hands and bowing their head, or by
prostrating the body and touching the floor with the forehead, the
forearms and knees. When one shows one’s respect in this way one should
do it thoughtfully and sincerely, remembering that this is another
opportunity for kusala citta.

We may pay respect to the Triple Gem in prostrating before a Buddha
statue and reciting words of praise while we think of the excellent
qualities of the Buddha, the Dhamma and the Sangha. However, there are
not kusala cittas all the time. When we experience some bodily
discomfort akusala cittas with aversion tend to arise. Or we may think
of other things with attachment or aversion. We should know the
difference between kusala citta and akusala citta, they arise because of
their own conditions and they are not self. While we are reciting words
of praise to the Triple Gem there can be mindfulness of realities which
appear, even if these are akusala dhammas. Mindfulness of whatever
reality appears is the best way of respect we can give to the Buddha
since we then follow what he taught.

We read in the *Dhammapada* (verse 109)[(210)](#FOOT210) about the
fruits of paying respect:

 ``` 
 He of respectful nature who 
 Ever the elders honouring, 
 Four qualities for him increase: 
 Long-life and beauty, happiness and 
 strength. 
 
 ``` 

The “base of meritorious action” which is dutifulness or helpfulness is
also an aspect of sīla. When there are opportunities for helping others
we tend to be lazy and forgetful, we are slow in our reactions instead
of responding quickly to the needs of someone else. For example, when we
are reading an interesting book we may not be inclined to get up and
help someone who needs help. If we remember that there are many ways of
helping others, that even helping in small matters is beneficial, there
will be conditions to use such opportunities for kusala. We may, for
example, show someone who got lost the right way, we may help someone in
handing him a cup or a dish he needs, or we may help in listening to
someone’s problems and giving him advice.

Another one of the bases of meritorious deeds is listening to Dhamma and
this is included in mental development. When we listen to the Dhamma and
study it we learn what is kusala and what akusala, we learn about kamma
and vipāka and the way how to develop kusala. Development of calm and of
insight starts with listening; there could not be any mental development
if one does not know how to apply oneself to it. Listening to the Dhamma
or reading the scriptures and considering what we learnt are conditions
for the arising of mindfulness of nāma and rūpa. Although we know that
listening to the Dhamma and studying it is beneficial we may be inclined
to put it off. We believe that we have too many duties to perform or we
are distracted by the enjoyment of pleasant objects. When we really see
the usefulness of the study of the Dhamma we can accumulate the
inclination to listen to the Dhamma or to read the scriptures. Reading
even a few lines at a time can be most beneficial.

Teaching or explaining the Dhamma is another one of the ten “bases of
meritorious deeds”. Both the person who explains the Dhamma and the
listener can benefit, since both are reminded of the truth of Dhamma and
of the need to apply the Dhamma. Teaching Dhamma is not easy, one should
consider the capacity of the listener to receive the Dhamma. One can
start with subjects which are more easily understandable such as
generosity, and later on explain about the development of understanding
which eradicates defilements. It is essential to learn about the ways of
developing generosity and to apply them, because if one cannot give up
things one possesses how could one give up clinging to self and other
defilements? The Buddha preached to general Sīha a graduated discourse
on almsgiving, the precepts and on heaven (Gradual Sayings, Book of the
Eights, Chapter 2, par 2). When the Buddha saw that Sīha was ready to
receive the teaching of the four noble Truths he taught these to him.
The teaching of Dhamma should be gradual; in the beginning one does not
see the disadvantages of clinging. When one understands the dangers of
defilements one wants to learn to develop the way leading to the
eradication of defilements. The gift of Dhamma is the highest gift
because through learning the Dhamma one can develop the understanding
which eradicates defilements and leads to the end of dukkha. Thus, the
teaching of Dhamma can also be considered as an aspect of generosity,
dāna.

Both the development of calm and the development of insight are ways of
mental development, they are among the “bases of meritorious deeds”. As
regards calm, this can be developed for the purpose of temporarily
subduing defilements. The *Visuddhimagga* (Chapter III-XI) explains how
calm can be developed even to the degree of jhāna by means of a
meditation subject. It is extremely difficult to develop calm to the
stage of jhāna, but some of the meditation subjects which are dealt with
in the *Visuddhimagga* can also be used as recollections in daily life
and then they can condition mahā-kusala cittas. The “ten bases of
meritorious deeds” are objects of mahā-kusala cittas, kusala cittas of
the sense-sphere, and, therefore, calm to the degree of jhāna is not
dealt with in this context by the *Atthasālinī*. Those who have
accumulated conditions for the attainment of jhāna have first to
develop, by means of a meditation subject, calm which accompanies
mahā-kusala citta.

In order to develop calm we should know when the citta is akusala citta
and when kusala citta. When we have studied the akusala cetasikas and
sobhana cetasikas we know in theory what is akusala citta and what is
kusala citta, but we may not be able yet to apply our knowledge in daily
life. We may not know what type of citta arises at the present moment.
There are innumerable moments of clinging after seeing, hearing and the
other sense-cognitions, but we do not notice them. When clinging is not
as coarse as greed or lust it may pass unnoticed. When we make plans
what to do next, when we go somewhere, when we want to get something or
when we want a rest in the afternoon there are likely to be countless
moments of clinging. We have learnt that the development of loving
kindness, compassion, sympathetic joy and equanimity in daily life can
condition moments of calm, but it is difficult to recognize the
characteristic of calm. We may erroneously believe that the citta is
kusala citta with calm when it is accompanied by indifferent feeling.
However, kusala citta as well as akusala citta can be accompanied by
indifferent feeling. It is essential to learn more about our different
cittas and this is mental development. When we know the characteristic
of true calm which arises with kusala citta, calm can be developed.

As regards vipassanā, insight, this is the understanding of realities
which can eradicate the latent tendencies of defilements so that they
cannot arise again. If we develop good qualities without developing
right understanding of realities defilements cannot be eradicated.
Akusala cittas are bound to arise time and again, even in between the
moments we are performing good deeds. The eradication of defilements is
the goal of the Buddha’s teachings. For mindfulness of nāma and rūpa
there is an opportunity at any time, but when mindfulness has not been
accumulated it does not often arise. We may become impatient and have
aversion when there is lack of mindfulness, but then we should remember
that the moments of awareness and also the moments of forgetfulness
arise because of conditions, that they are not self. Moments of
ignorance of realities are real, thus, they can also be object of
awareness.

One of the “Perfections”, the wholesome qualities the Bodhisatta
developed, was determination, the resolution to continue developing
understanding in whatever situation he was. We read in the commentary to
the “Cariyāpiṭaka” (the Paramatthadīpanī VII)[(211)](#FOOT211) :

> …For when the Great Man, straining and striving for the fulfilment of
> the requisites of enlightenment, encounters troubles difficult to
> endure, depriving him of happiness and his means of support, or when
> he encounters injuries imposed by beings and formations—difficult to
> overcome, violent, sapping the vitality— then, since he has
> surrendered himself to the Buddhas, he reflects: “I have relinquished
> my very self to the Buddhas. Whatever comes, let it come.” For this
> reason he does not waver, does not quake, does not undergo the least
> vacillation, but remains absolutely unshaken in his determination to
> undertake the good.

When we are in very unpleasant circumstances we find it difficult to be
mindful of realities. We lack determination. We want to control the
experience of sense objects, we want objects to be pleasant. We forget
that the experience of sense objects such as seeing or hearing is
vipāka, conditioned by kamma. The realities which appear have been
conditioned already and if we learn to be mindful of them there will be
less inclination to try to exert control over them. Then there will be
more patience and more determination to continue developing right
understanding in whatever situation.

The tenth “base of meritorious deeds” is “rectification of view”. There
are many degrees of this way of wholesomeness. Before we studied the
Dhamma we may have considered the enjoyment of pleasant sense objects to
be the goal of our life. As we gradually come to see that selfishness
leads to unhappiness and that kusala is beneficial both for ourselves
and for others we start to correct our wrong ideas. We may, for example,
be absorbed in the enjoyment of something pleasant such as listening to
music, but then, when someone else suddenly needs our help, we may
realize that it is more beneficial to help someone than to continue
being selfish. However, each situation is conditioned and there is no
self who can choose what action he will perform in a given situation. We
correct our views when we come to understand that wholesome deeds are
kusala kamma which will produce kusala vipāka. We should not cling to
pleasant results, that is akusala. Kamma will produce its result, no
matter whether or not we think of it. While we are performing good deeds
there can be understanding of cause and effect without clinging. We
correct our views most of all by developing right understanding of
realities. In that way the clinging to the concept of self will
decrease, we will be less inclined to take akusala or kusala for self.
The “rectification of view” can go together with the other nine “bases
of meritorious deeds”, thus, with any kind of wholesome action.

The ten “bases of meritorious deeds” are included in generosity, sīla
and mental development. The Buddha, when he was a Bodhisatta, developed
with perseverance all kinds of wholesomeness together with right
understanding. He had no selfish purposes but he was truly intent on the
happiness of all beings. We read in the *Dialogues of the Buddha* (III,
no. 30, “The Marks of the Superman”) about the good deeds he performed
during the lives he was a Bodhisatta, about the results produced by his
good deeds, and about the special bodily features which are the “marks”
of a Buddha and which are conditioned by these good deeds. I shall quote
some passages which deal with his generosity, his purity of conduct and
his wisdom:

> …Whereas in whatsoever former birth, former state of becoming, former
> sojourning, monks, the Tathāgata, then being human, took on mighty
> enterprise in all good things, took on unfaltering enterprise in all
> good things, took on unfaltering enterprise in seemly course of deed
> and word and thought:—in dispensing gifts, in virtuous undertakings,
> in keeping of festivals, in filial duties to mother and father, in
> pious duties to recluse and brahmin, in honour of the head of the
> house and in other such things of lofty merit…(145) …Whereas in

This sutta can encourage us to apply the Buddha’s teachings. The
Bodhisatta gave us an example to always be eager to listen and to learn,
to develop all kinds of good qualities and above all, to develop
understanding of realities. When we read about all the virtues the
Bodhisatta accumulated in his former lives, we can be reminded that the
effect of the development of understanding will eventually be to have
less defilements, to become less selfish and more generous, to have more
genuine concern for other people.
