### Cetanā as a link in the “Dependant Origination” 

Cetanā as a link in the “Dependant Origination” is called
*abhisaṅkhāra.* There are three kinds of *abhisaṅkhāra*:

1. meritorious kamma-formations (puññ’ābhisaṅkhāra)[(224)](#FOOT224)
2. demeritorious kamma-formations (apuññ’ābhisaṅkhāra)
3. imperturbable kamma-formations (āneñj’ābhisaṅkhāra)

*Meritorious kamma-formations* are the cetanās which accompany the eight
kāmāvacara kusala cittas or mahā-kusala cittas (kusala cittas of the
sense-sphere)[(225)](#FOOT225), and the five rūpāvacara kusala cittas
(rūpa-jhānacittas)[(226)](#FOOT226).

*Demeritorious kamma-formations* are the cetanās which accompany the
twelve akusala cittas, which are: eight lobha-mūla-cittas, two
dosa-mūla-cittas and two moha-mūla-cittas.

*Imperturbable kamma-formations* are the cetanās which accompany the
four arūpāvacara kusala cittas (arūpa-jhānacittas). The meritorious
kamma-formations and the demeritorious kamma-formations which produce
rebirth-consciousness also produce rūpa. The imperturbable
kamma-formations do not produce rūpa. Those who cultivate arūpa-jhāna
have realized the disadvantages of rūpa. The arūpāvacara kusala cittas
which are very tranquil, very refined, produce rebirth-consciousness in
the relevant arūpa-brahma planes where there is no rūpa and no
sense-impressions. There are four arūpa-brahma planes corresponding to
the four stages of arūpa-jhāna.

These three classes of kamma-formations are a link in the Dependent
Origination.
