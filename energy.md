Determination (adhimokkha) {.section}
-------------------------------

Adhimokkha, determination or resolution, is another cetasika among the
six “particulars” which arises with cittas of the four jātis but not
with every citta.

The *Visuddhimagga* ( XIV, 151) gives the following definition of
adhimokkha:

The act of resolving is resolution. It has the characteristic of
conviction. Its function is not to grope. It is manifested as
decisiveness. Its proximate cause is a thing to be convinced about. It
should be regarded as like a boundary-post owing to its immovableness
with regard to the object.

The “Paramattha Mañjūsā” (489), the commentary to the *Visuddhimagga*,
states that:

> “ the act of resolving should be understood as the act of being
> convinced about an object”.

The *Atthasālinī* (I, Part IV, Chapter I, 133) gives a definition
similar to the one of the *Visuddhimagga*[(57)](#FOOT57)

Adhimokkha is not the same as what we usually mean by the words
“determination” and “decision” in conventional language. In order to
understand the characteristic of adhimokkha we should know which types
of citta it accompanies.

Since adhimokkha is one of the “particulars” it accompanies cittas of
the four jātis and thus it can be kusala, akusala, vipāka or kiriya. As
we have seen, the “particulars” do not arise with every citta.
Adhimokkha does not accompany the dvi-pañcaviññāṇas (sense-cognitions)
which are accompanied only by the “universals”, not by other types of
cetasikas. Seeing-consciousness, for example, arises at the eye-base and
sees visible object. It does not need, apart from the seven
“universals”, adhimokkha or any other cetasika in order to see visible
object.

Adhimokkha does not arise either with the type of moha-mūla-citta (citta
rooted in ignorance) which is *accompanied by doubt (vicikicchā).* When
there is doubt there cannot be at the same time the cetasika adhimokkha
which “does not grope” and is “convinced” about the object.

Adhimokkha accompanies all cittas other than the afore-mentioned cittas.
It arises in the sense-door process as well as in the mind-door process.
Adhimokkha is one among the cetasikas which assist citta in cognizing
its object. Adhimokkha also accompanies the cittas which do not arise in
a process: the paṭisandhi-citta, the bhavanga-citta and the cuti-citta.
It is “convinced” about the object these cittas experience.

When we hear the word “decision” or “determination”, we usually
associate this word with a decision we have to consider carefully. We
may not have expected adhimokkha to arise in a sense-door process, but,
as we have seen, it arises in sense-door processes as well as in
mind-door processes and it assists the citta in cognizing the object.

Adhimokkha which accompanies akusala citta is determination which is
akusala. When one, for example, speaks harshly or hits someone else,
there is akusala adhimokkha which is convinced about the object of
aversion. Adhimokkha which accompanies kusala citta is determination
which is kusala. When one, for example, decides with kusala citta to
study the Dhamma, kusala adhimokkha accompanies the kusala citta.
However, at such a moment there are also many other wholesome cetasikas
accompanying the kusala citta and adhimokkha is only one of them. It is
difficult to know exactly what adhimokkha is. There is, for example,
kusala cetanā which “wills” kusala, there is non-attachment, alobha, and
there are many other cetasikas which each have their own task in
assisting the citta to perform its function. They all take part in “
deciding” to study the Dhamma.

When one develops calm there is adhimokkha which is determined, sure
about the object, which is in this case an object of samatha. When jhāna
is attained adhimokkha accompanies the jhāna-citta and it performs its
function of being determined as to the object of absorption.

When one develops right understanding of nāma and rūpa, there is
adhimokkha accompanying the kusala citta. We may believe that *we* can
decide to make sati arise, but there is *no self* who can decide this.
When there are the appropriate conditions for sati and paññā they arise
and then there is also adhimokkha which performs its function while it
accompanies the kusala citta. When one begins to develop right
understanding of nāma and rūpa, there will be doubt as to their
different characteristics. When there is doubt adhimokkha does not
arise. When there is right mindfulness of the nāma or rūpa which
appears, adhimokkha performs its function of being “convinced”, sure
about the object.

Adhimokkha which accompanies lokuttara citta is “convinced”, sure about
the object which is nibbāna.

Adhimokkha is not self; it is saṅkhāra dhamma, a conditioned dhamma
which arises and falls away with the citta it accompanies. It performs
its function only while it is accompanying the citta and then it falls
away together with the citta. If the next citta is accompanied by
adhimokkha it is another adhimokkha and this falls away again.

Since adhimokkha arises with all cittas except the ten pañca-viññāṇas
and the type of moha-mūla-citta which is accompanied by doubt, it arises
with seventy-eight cittas in all[(58)](#FOOT58).

10.2 Energy (viriya) {.section}
--------------------

Viriya, energy or effort, is another cetasika among the “particulars”
which arises with cittas of the four jātis but not with every citta. The
*Visuddhimagga* ( XIV, 137) states concerning viriya:

Energy (viriya) is the state of one who is vigorous (vīra). Its
characteristic is marshalling (driving). Its function is to consolidate
conascent states (the accompanying citta and cetasikas). It is
manifested as non-collapse. Because of the words “Bestirred, he strives
wisely” (*Gradual Sayings* II, 115), its proximate cause is a sense of
urgency; or its proximate cause is grounds for the initiation of energy.
When rightly initiated, it should be regarded as the root of all
attainments.

Viriya which is the root of all attainments is right effort, viriya
accompanying kusala citta. Since viriya accompanies cittas of the four
jātis, there is also akusala viriya, viriya accompanying vipākacitta and
viriya accompanying kiriyacitta.

The *Atthasālinī* (I, Part IV, Chapter I, 120,121) gives a definition of
viriya which is similar to the one given by the *Visuddhimagga.* Apart
from this definition it gives first another one and here it deals with
viriya under the aspect of “controlling faculty” or *indriya*. The Pāli
term “indriya” means “governing or ruling principle”. When kusala viriya
has been developed it becomes a “controlling faculty”. The controlling
faculty of viriya “controls” or inhibits laziness, a defilement opposed
to energy[(59)](#FOOT59). We read in the *Atthasālinī*:

> From its overcoming idleness it is a controlling faculty in the sense
> of predominance …Its characteristic is strengthening, and grasp or
> support. As an old house stands when strengthened by new pillars, so
> the aspirant (meditator), when strengthened by energy, does not fall
> off or deteriorate as to moral states. Thus should the characteristic
> of strengthening be understood…

The *Atthasālinī* then uses a simile of a small army which, if it goes
to battle, might be repulsed. However, when they are supported by a
strong reinforcement sent by the king, they can defeat the hostile army.
We read:

> …thus energy does not allow associated states to recede, to retreat;
> it uplifts, supports them. Hence it has been said that energy has the
> characteristic of supporting.

The word “energy” as it is used in conventional language does not render
the precise meaning of viriya. When we for example say that we are full
of energy, what do we mean? Energy for what? Is it energy accompanying
akusala citta or energy accompanying kusala citta? Besides, there are
also vipākacittas and kiriyacittas which are accompanied by viriya. We
are inclined to take energy for self, but energy is saṅkhāra dhamma, a
conditioned dhamma. Energy is conditioned by the citta and the other
cetasikas it accompanies and thus there is a different kind of energy
with different cittas. In order to have more understanding about viriya
we should study which types of cittas it accompanies.

Viriya accompanies all akusala cittas and all sobhana
cittas[(60)](#FOOT60) (including jhānacittas and lokuttara cittas), but
it does not arise with all vipākacittas and with all kiriyacittas.
Viriya does not accompany the dvi-pañca-viññāṇas, the sense-cognitions.
Seeing or hearing do not need viriya in order to experience their
objects. The mind-door adverting-consciousness,
*mano-dvārāvajjana-citta* and the *hasituppāda-citta* which causes
smiling in the case of arahats are the only ahetuka cittas (rootless
cittas) which are accompanied by viriya[(61)](#FOOT61).

We read in the *Visuddhimagga* that the *function of viriya* is *to
consolidate conascent states.* Viriya strengthens, supports the citta
and the other cetasikas it accompanies so that they can carry out their
work and do not “collapse”.

Viriya accompanies every kusala citta and it supports the citta and
accompanying cetasikas so that they can carry out their work in a
wholesome way. When there is loving kindness, it is strengthened and
supported by kusala viriya. If there were no viriya accompanying the
kusala citta, no kusala could be performed. Also when the citta is
akusala citta, viriya accompanies the citta and the cetasikas so that
they can carry out their work in the unwholesome way. Viriya accompanies
every akusala citta. When there is anger, dosa, it is strengthened and
supported by viriya. Viriya which accompanies akusala citta is wrong
effort and viriya which accompanies kusala citta is right effort.

Kusala viriya can be energy for dāna, for sīla, for samatha or for
vipassanā. It depends on conditions which type of kusala arises at a
particular moment. If one wants, for example, to subdue defilements
through the development of calm and one knows how to develop calm, there
is energy and perseverance with the development of calm. If one’s goal
is knowing realities as they are there are conditions for energy for
vipassanā. This kind of energy or effort arises together with the citta
which is mindful of a nāma or rūpa appearing now, at this moment. Right
effort arises because of its own conditions; there is no self who can
exert himself. When we have a notion of self who has to make an effort
to be aware, there is wrong effort instead of right effort. Right effort
is a conditioned dhamma, saṅkhāra dhamma, which arises because of its
own conditions. It does not last, it falls away immediately with the
citta it accompanies and then wrong effort may arise.

As we read in the definition of the *Visuddhimagga*, the proximate cause
of viriya is “a sense of urgency or grounds for the initiation of
energy”. Birth, old age and death can remind us of the urgency to
develop right understanding which eventually will lead to freedom from
the cycle of birth and death. When we are “urged” to be mindful of
realities, there is no self who makes an effort to be mindful. Right
effort which is a reality arising because of its own conditions
strengthens and supports the citta with mindfulness. There is energy,
courage and perseverance to develop the eightfold Path since this is the
only way leading to the end of dukkha.

The *Visuddhimagga* and the *Atthasālinī*, when they mention that the
proximate cause of viriya is a sense of urgency, quote the words,
“bestirred, he strives wisely”, from a sutta of the *Gradual Sayings*
(Book of the Fours, Chapter XII, par3, The Goad). In this sutta we read
about four kinds of horses. One horse is already stirred to activity
when he sees the shadow of the goadstick, whereas another one is not
stirred by that, but is only stirred when his coat is pricked by the
goad. Another one is stirred only when his flesh is pierced by the goad.
We read about the fourth kind of horse:

Once more, monks, we may have a goodly thorough-bred steed, which is
stirred, feels agitation neither at the sight of the goadstick nor when
his coat is pricked, nor yet when his flesh is pierced with the
goadstick; but when he is pierced to the very bone he is stirred…

We then read about four kinds of people who are compared to these
horses:

> In this case, monks, here we may have a certain goodly thorough-bred
> man who hears it said that in such and such a village or township is a
> woman or a man afflicted or dead. Thereat he is stirred, he feels
> agitation. Thus agitated he strictly applies himself. Thus applied he
> both realizes in his own person the supreme truth, and sees it by
> penetrating it with wisdom…
>
> Again, monks, here we may have a goodly thoroughbred man who does not
> hear it said that in such or such a village or township is a woman or
> a man afflicted or dead, but with his own eyes sees it. Thereupon he
> is stirred…
>
> Then again, monks, here we may have a certain goodly thorough-bred man
> who does not hear it said…nor yet with his own eyes sees a woman or
> man afflicted or dead, but his own kinsman or blood-relation is
> afflicted or dead. Thereupon he is stirred…
>
> Once more, monks, here we may have a goodly thoroughbred man who
> neither hears it said…nor yet with his own eyes sees… nor is his own
> kinsman or blood-relation afflicted or dead, but he himself is
> stricken with painful bodily feelings, grievous, sharp, racking,
> distracting, discomforting, that drain the life away. Thereat he is
> stirred, he feels agitation. Being so stirred he strictly applies
> himself. Thus applied he both realizes with his own person the supreme
> truth and sees it by penetrating it with wisdom…

Sickness, old age and death are realities of daily life which can remind
us of the urgency to develop right understanding, they are like a
“goadstick” which can “stir” us. They are the proximate cause of right
effort, which is energy for mindfulness of the reality appearing at the
present moment.

Viriya is the “root of all attainments”, as we read in the definition by
the *Visuddhimagga*. Right effort is an *indriya*, controlling faculty,
which has to be developed together with the other indriyas for the
attainment of jhāna and the attainment of enlightenment. As the
*Atthasālinī* states, viriya is the indriya which “controls” or inhibits
laziness. Laziness is an obstruction to jhāna and to enlightenment.
Right effort can also be seen under the aspect of *path-factor* and as
such it is called *sammā-vāyāma of the eightfold Path.* Right effort has
to accompany right understanding, sammā-diṭṭhi, of the eightfold Path in
order to be a path-factor. Right effort of the eightfold Path develops
through mahā-satipaṭṭhāna, the “four applications of mindfulness”. When
there is mindfulness of the reality which appears at the present moment
there is also right effort.

Viriya is one of the *factors of enlightenment, bojjhangas.* The factors
of enlightenment are: mindfulness (sati), investigation of the Dhamma
(dhammavicaya, which is paññā), viriya, enthusiasm (pīti), calm
(passaddhi), concentration (samādhi) and equanimity (upekkhā). When the
enlightenment factors have been developed they lead to the realization
of the four noble Truths. The enlightenment factors reach completion
through the development of mahā-satipaṭṭhāna[(62)](#FOOT62).

Thus we see that there are different aspects to right effort. We read in
the scriptures about “ four right endeavours” and these are aspects of
right effort. We read for example in the *Middle Length Sayings* (III,
141, the Analysis of the Truths) that Sāriputta explained to the monks
the four noble Truths. He spoke about dukkha, its origination, its
cessation and the way leading to its cessation , the eightfold Path. He
explained about right effort, one of the factors of the eightfold Path,
and he pointed out that there are four right endeavours:

> And what, your reverences, is right endeavour? As to this, your
> reverences, a monk generates desire, endeavours, stirs up energy,
> exerts his mind and strives for the non-arising of evil unskilled
> states that have not arisen…for the getting rid of evil unskilled
> states that have arisen…for the arising of skilled states that have
> not arisen…for the maintenance, preservation, increase, maturity,
> development and completion of skilled states that have arisen. This,
> your reverences, is called right endeavour.

When there is mindfulness of visible object which appears now, seeing
which appears now, sound which appears now, hearing which appears now,
or any other reality which appears now, right understanding of the
eightfold Path is being developed. This is the most effective way to
avoid akusala, to overcome it, to make kusala arise and to maintain
kusala and bring it to perfection. At the moment of right mindfulness
right effort performs its task of strengthening the kusala citta so that
there is perseverance with the development of the eightfold Path.
