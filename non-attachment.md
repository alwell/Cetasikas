Non-Attachment (alobha) 
-----------------------

Non-attachment, alobha, is one of the three sobhana hetus, beautiful
roots. A root (hetu or mūla) gives a firm support to the citta and
cetasikas it arises together with. All sobhana cittas are rooted in
non-attachment, alobha, and non-aversion, adosa, and they may or may not
be rooted in wisdom, paññā. Thus, non-attachment has to accompany every
sobhana citta.

We have many more moments with attachment than with non-attachment and
we are so used to live with attachment that we hardly realize that it is
akusala. A person who is leading the life of a layman takes it for
granted to be attached to people and possessions. We may think that such
kinds of attachment are not dangerous, provided we do not harm others,
but all kinds of akusala lead to sorrow. There is attachment time and
again and, thus, we accumulate it evermore. When we stand up, move
around, reach for things, eat or go to sleep, we *want* most of the time
something for ourselves and then there are cittas rooted in attachment.
We are almost all the time thinking of ourselves, we try to acquire
pleasant things for ourselves and we expect other people to be agreeable
to us. Even when we think that we apply ourselves to kusala, for
example, when we listen to the Dhamma or speak about the Dhamma, there
are likely to be many moments of attachment arising after the kusala
cittas. We may be attached to “our kusala”, we tend to like the idea of
ourselves being good and wise, we find ourselves important.

If we come to know more precisely the citta arising at the present
moment we will be able to notice that the moments of clinging are
entirely different from the moments of unselfishness or detachment.
There is non-attachment with every kusala citta, but it does not last.
There are many more akusala cittas in our life than kusala cittas.

Non-attachment, alobha, has many shades and degrees. It can be described
as unselfishness, liberality or generosity. There is alobha when there
are thoughts of sacrifice and sharing, when there is renunciation and
dispassion[(162)](#FOOT162).

The *Atthasālinī* (I, Book I, Part IV, Chapter I, 127) gives the
following definition of alobha:

> …absence of greed (alobha) has the characteristic of the mind being
> free from cupidity for an object of thought, or of its being detached,
> like a drop of water on a lotus leaf. It has the function of not
> appropriating, like an emancipated monk, and the manifestation of
> detachment, like a man fallen into a foul place…

The *Visuddhimagga* (XIV, 143) gives a similar
definition[(163)](#FOOT163).

When there is a moment of non-attachment there cannot be attachment at
the same time. Non-attachment has the characteristic of non-adherence
like a water drop on a lotus leaf. The lotus grows in the water but it
is not wetted by the water, that is its nature. A drop of water glides
off a lotus leaf without affecting it. So it is with non-attachment,
alobha. It is not attached to the object which is experienced, it is
unaffected by it. That is the nature of non-attachment. Sometimes there
are conditions for non-attachment, but shortly afterwards we are
affected again by objects. Through right understanding one will become
less affected. We read in the *Sutta Nipāta* (Khuddaka Nikāya, The Group
of Discourses, vs. 811-813,)[(164)](#FOOT164) :

> …Not being dependent upon anything, a sage holds nothing as being
> pleasant or unpleasant. Lamentation and avarice do not cling to him,
> as water does not cling to a (lotus-)leaf.
>
> Just as a drop of water does not cling to a (lotus-)leaf, as water
> does not cling to a lotus, so a sage does not cling to what is seen or
> heard or thought.
>
> Therefore a purified one does not think that purity is by means of
> what is seen, heard, or thought, nor does he wish for purity by
> anything else[(165)](#FOOT165). He is neither impassioned nor
> dispassioned.

The function of non-attachment is, as we have seen, “not appropriating,
like an emancipated monk”. A monk who has attained arahatship does not
hold on to any object which presents itself; he is not enslaved but
completely detached and thus free, emancipated.

The *Atthasālinī* states that non-attachment has the manifestation of
detachment like someone who has fallen into a foul place. Someone who
falls into a cesspool does not consider that a place of shelter where he
could stay. He sees it as a danger, as something to be abhorred, and
therefore, he would get out of it as soon as possible. It is the same
with non-attachment, it does not take refuge in what is actually a
danger. Attachment to the objects which are experienced is dangerous,
because attachment leads to all kinds of evil deeds which can produce an
unhappy rebirth. Any form of attachment, even if it is more subtle, is
dangerous, because so long as attachment has not been eradicated we are
subject to rebirth and, thus, also to old age, sickness and death.

It is difficult to know the characteristic of non-attachment, since the
moments of non-attachment are rare. We are often too lazy to do
something for someone else; we are attached to our own comfort or to
quiet. Or we may find some excuses: the weather is too cold or too hot
to exert ourselves for someone else. However, when there are conditions
for non-attachment, we do not care about tiredness or discomfort, we do
not think of ourselves but we see the usefulness of helping someone
else. We can learn from experience that non-attachment is beneficial
both for ourselves and for others. At the moment of non-attachment we
renounce our own pleasure and then there is peace of mind. It may seem
that at a particular moment a choice between kusala and akusala can be
made, but there is no self who makes a choice; each moment of citta is
conditioned by many factors. It is not self but the cetasika alobha
which performs the function of detachment. We cannot force ourselves to
renounce sense-pleasures, but we can learn the difference between the
characteristic of kusala and of akusala when they appear. Thus, we will
gradually see that kusala is beneficial and that akusala is not
beneficial but harmful.

Whenever kusala citta arises non-attachment accompanies the kusala
citta. Non-attachment can arise in the sense-door processes of citta as
well as in the mind-door process. In each of these processes there are
javana-cittas (translated as “impulsion”), which are, in the case of
non-arahats, kusala cittas or akusala cittas. When kusala citta arises
there is “wise attention” to the object which is experienced, there are
no attachment, aversion and ignorance. Non-attachment which accompanies
the kusala citta may, for example, arise in the eye-door process of
cittas which experience visible object. We usually cling to visible
object but when there are conditions for kusala citta there is
non-attachment to the object.

When we perform a good deed, there is non-attachment already, we do not
have to try to be detached or to renounce something. When we perform
dāna we give up our selfish inclination and we think of the benefit of
someone else, at least for that moment. When we refrain from harsh
speech we give up something, we renounce evil speech by which we harm
both ourselves and others. When there is loving kindness, which is the
cetasika non-aversion, adosa, there must be non-attachment as well which
renounces selfishness. When there is selfish affection for other people
there cannot be loving kindness at the same time. When we are attached
to someone, our attachment does not do him any good, we only cling to
our own pleasant feeling we derive from his or her company. It is
essential to know our own different feelings. We should find out when
pleasant feeling goes together with selfishness and when it is the joy
which may accompany kusala citta. We are so attached to just having
pleasant feeling that we do not notice when it is akusala and, thus,
useless. At the moment loving kindness or compassion arises there is
genuine concern for someone else and we forget for a few moments the “I”
we often consider the centre of the world.

There are many degrees of non-attachment. Right understanding is the
condition for higher degrees of non-attachment. If right understanding
knows when there is akusala citta and when kusala citta, there can be
the development of calm. Calm can be developed with meditation subjects
such as loving kindness, the contemplation of the Buddha’s virtues, the
foulness of the body or other subjects. The citta with calm is
accompanied by non-attachment. When calm has been developed to the
degree of jhāna, defilements are temporarily subdued but they are not
eradicated. Attachment to one’s attainment of jhāna may arise. Only the
development of insight can eventually lead to complete detachment from
all objects.

The direct understanding of nāma and rūpa will lead to detachment from
them. So long as there is still the wrong view of self, attachment
cannot be eradicated. We are attached to persons, to “self”, and we may
not be ready to accept the truth that in the ultimate sense no “people”
exist. If right understanding of realities is developed we will know
that what we take for people are only citta, cetasika and rūpa which do
not last.

In the beginning it is difficult to persevere being mindful of seeing,
visible object and the other realities, because we do not notice an
immediate result and we sometimes doubt whether it is really useful. Is
helping someone else not more useful than being aware of visible object
which appears now? All degrees of kusala are useful and we should not
neglect any one of them. If we help someone else or listen to him with
loving kindness and compassion, there are moments of giving up our
selfishness. But shortly after the kusala cittas have fallen away there
tend to be akusala cittas with clinging to “our kusala” or with
attachment to people. Also while we help others there can be mindfulness
of realities such as seeing or visible object. In this way we will
become truly convinced that what is seen is not a person, only a reality
which can be experienced through the eyes. There is already a degree of
detachment, although it is still weak, when there is mindfulness of
visible object and understanding of it as “only a reality”, not a
person. In the beginning understanding is weak, but we should have
confidence that it can be developed through mindfulness of whatever
reality appears through one of the six doors. Thus clinging to “self” or
to beings can decrease.

The sotāpanna has eradicated all clinging to the concept of self, but he
still clings to sensuous objects. The sakadāgāmī has less clinging to
sensuous objects but he still has not eradicated it. The anāgāmī has
eradicated clinging to sensuous objects but he still clings to rebirth
and he still has cittas rooted in attachment which are accompanied by
conceit. The arahat has eradicated all forms of clinging and this shows
how hard it is to eradicate it. We may think that we cannot be happy
without attachment, but complete detachment means the highest happiness,
it is freedom from all sorrow.

We may have read in the scriptures that clinging is the root of sorrow,
but we tend to forget this. We read, for example, in the *Middle Length
Sayings* (II, no. 87, Discourse on “Born of Affection”) that the Buddha
explained to a householder who had lost his only son, that “grief,
sorrow, suffering, lamentation and despair are born of affection,
originate in affection”. However, the householder did not accept this
truth. We read that King Pasenadi spoke about this subject with Queen
Mallikā. When the Queen said that she agreed with the Buddha’s words,
the King was displeased. Further on we read that the Queen tried to
explain the truth of the Buddha’s words to the King with examples from
his daily life. She said :

> …“What do you think about this, sire? Is your daughter Vajīrī dear to
> you?”
>
> “Yes, Mallikā. My daughter Vajīrī is dear to me.”
>
> “What do you think about this, sire? From an alteration and otherness
> in your daughter Vajīrī would there arise in you grief, sorrow,
> suffering, lamentation and despair?”
>
> “From an alteration and otherness, Mallikā, in my daughter Vajīrī
> there would be a change for me, even for life. How should there not
> arise in me grief, sorrow, suffering, lamentation and despair?”
>
> “It was in reference to this, sire, that it was said by the Lord, who
> knows, who sees, perfected one, fully Self-Awakened One: ’Grief,
> sorrow, suffering, lamentation and despair are born of affection,
> originate in affection.’ …”
>
> The Queen then asked the same question with regard to the noble lady
> Vāsabhā, the King’s consort, General Viḍūḍabha, the son of the King
> and Vāsabhā, and the peoples of Kāsi and Kosala. The King then
> understood the truth of the Buddha’s words and he thereupon paid
> respect to the Buddha and uttered words of praise.

We often forget the truth that suffering is rooted in desire. There is
most of the time clinging after seeing, hearing or the other experiences
through the senses. We have to read and reread the scriptures many times
and consider the Buddha’s words. His teaching is like food for our mind.
If we realize that clinging is the root of all sorrow and suffering we
will develop right understanding at this moment so that, eventually,
there will be detachment from all objects.

### Questions

1. Are all kinds of kusala helpful in order to be less selfish?
2. Why can calm when it is developed in samatha not eradicate clinging?
3. Why is the development of insight the only way to become detached
 from all objects?
4. Why has only the arahat eradicated clinging completely?
