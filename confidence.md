## Confidence

Saddhā, confidence or faith, is one of the sobhana cetasikas which
arises with every sobhana citta: with the sobhana cittas of the
sense-sphere (kāma-sobhana cittas), with the rūpāvacara cittas, with the
arūpāvacara cittas and with the lokuttara cittas. Saddhā is not blind
faith in a person, it is confidence in wholesomeness. There is saddhā
with dāna, with sīla and with bhāvanā. There cannot be any kind of
wholesomeness without saddhā. Saddhā is called by the *Atthasālinī* the
“forerunner” of wholesomeness.

The *Atthasālinī* (I, Part IV, Chapter I, 119) states about saddhā:

> …It has purifying or aspiring as its characteristic. As the
> water-purifying gem of the universal monarch thrown into water causes
> solids, alluvia, waterweeds and mud to subside and makes the water
> clear, transparent and undisturbed, so faith arising discards the
> hindrances, causes the corruptions to subside, purifies the mind and
> makes it undisturbed; the mind being purified, the aspirant of noble
> family gives gifts, observes the precepts, performs the duties of
> “uposatha”[(155)](#FOOT155) , and commences bhāvanā. Thus faith should
> be known to have purifying as its characteristic…

The *Atthasālinī* refers to a simile given in the *Questions of King
Milinda* (35)[(156)](#FOOT156) : a universal monarch crosses a small
stream with his army. The water has been polluted by the army but his
water-purifying gem purifies the water so that mud, sand and waterweeds
subside and the water becomes clear and undisturbed. The water which is
disturbed by pollution is like the mind which is disturbed by
defilements. Faith purifies the mind so that it becomes clear,
transparent and undisturbed.

As to the characteristic of “aspiring”, the *Atthasālinī* uses another
simile in order to explain this. A crowd standing on both banks of a
great river full of crocodiles, monsters, sharks and ogres, is afraid to
cross over. A hero crosses the river and repels the dangerous animals
with his sword, and leads the crowd in crossing over. The *Atthasālinī*
( 120) states:

> …So faith is the forerunner, the precursor to one who is giving gifts,
> observing the precepts, performing the duties of uposatha and
> commencing bhāvanā. Hence it has been said: Faith has purifying and
> aspiring as its characteristic.

The *Atthasālinī* also uses another method of defining saddhā:

> …Faith has confiding as its characteristic; purifying as its function,
> like the water-purifying gem, or aspiring faith as function, like the
> crossing of the floods; freedom from pollution or decision as its
> manifestation; an object worthy of faith or factors of “streamwinning”
> as its proximate cause.

The *Visuddhimagga* (XIV, 140) defines confidence in the same way as the
*Atthasālinī* in the second method.

When akusala citta arises there is no confidence in kusala. For example,
when we are attached to a pleasant sight or when we have aversion
towards an ugly sight, there is forgetfulness of kusala, no aspiration
for it. Whereas, when there is faith or confidence, there is aspiration
for kusala. Only when people have confidence in the value of dāna, sīla
or bhāvanā will they apply themselves to it. It depends on a person’s
accumulations which kind of kusala he is inclined to perform. Some
people have confidence in dāna and sīla but they do not see the benefit
of being aware right now of seeing or hearing, in order to know these
realities as non-self.

As we have seen, purifying has been mentioned as a function of
confidence and freedom from pollution as one of its manifestations. When
the citta is accompanied by confidence, it is pure, free from the
hindrances. But so long as latent tendencies have not been eradicated
defilements are bound to arise, time and again. The purity of confidence
is in the ariyan of a higher degree than in the non-ariyan. The
sotāpanna does not cling to the concept of self, he has eradicated wrong
view, and thus his good deeds are purer. His sīla is more purified than
the sīla of the non-ariyan, he has no more conditions to transgress the
five precepts.

Another manifestation of confidence is decision or resolution. When
there is determination to accomplish kusala, it is evident that there is
confidence in kusala. There is no self who decides for kusala, it
depends on conditions whether or not kusala citta arises. When there are
conditions for aversion and discouragement, there is no resolution for
kusala. We may have no energy for any kind of kusala when we feel
annoyed because of our shortcomings, or when we are disappointed about
other people, when we feel lonely and depressed, when we find life
useless and frustrating. When we are depressed we are self- centred. We
want pleasant objects for ourselves and when we do not get these we feel
dissatisfied with life. If there would be less clinging to the self
there would be less conditions for feelings of frustration. Right
understanding can eventually eradicate the clinging to the self, but it
can only develop very gradually. If we are impatient because we do not
notice any progress in the development of right understanding, we should
remember the patience and determination of the Buddha in the lives when
he was still a Bodhisatta. He was determined to develop right
understanding life after life, without becoming discouraged, without
coming to a halt halfway. Courage and patience are needed in order to
develop understanding of the realities appearing in daily life. One has
to have “aspiring confidence” like the hero who crosses the floods. It
is useless to worry about the lack of mindfulness, or to think of ways
to make it arise. When there is more understanding of what the object of
mindfulness is, an ultimate reality, there are conditions for
mindfulness now of whatever reality appears.

“An object worthy of faith” is a proximate cause of confidence. The
Buddha, the Dhamma and the Sangha are objects worthy of confidence. This
does not mean that someone who never heard of the Dhamma cannot have
confidence. Confidence is an ultimate reality with its own
characteristic, it is not specifically Buddhist. Each kusala citta is
accompanied by confidence; kusala is kusala, no matter what nationality
or race one is, no matter what faith one professes. Also those who never
heard of the Dhamma can have confidence in ways of kusala such as
generosity and true loving kindness. Also good deeds are objects worthy
of confidence. If one listens to the Dhamma and develops right
understanding there are conditions for the eradication of akusala and
thus there will be more opportunity for the development of
wholesomeness.

The “factors of streamwinning”, that is the factors, necessary for
attaining the first stage of enlightenment, the stage of the
“streamwinner” or sotāpanna, are also a proximate cause for confidence.
These factors are: association with the right friend, hearing the
Dhamma, wise attention and practice in accordance with the
Dhamma[(157)](#FOOT157). Confidence in the Buddha, the Dhamma and the
Sangha starts with listening to the Dhamma as it is explained by the
right friend. We read in many suttas that people first listened to the
Buddha, considered what they heard and then took their refuge in the
Buddha, the Dhamma and the Sangha. Their confidence was based on
listening, inquiring and considering.

We read in the *Middle Length Sayings* (I, no. 4, Discourse on Fear and
Dread) that the Buddha, while staying near Sāvatthī, in the Jeta Grove,
spoke to the Brahman Jāṇussoṇi about his living in the forest without
fear and dread, and his attainment to Buddhahood. Jāṇussoṇi, after he
listened to the Buddha, took his refuge in the Buddha, the Dhamma and
the Sangha with the following words:

> …Excellent, good Gotama, excellent, good Gotama. It is as if one might
> set upright what had been upset, or might disclose what was covered,
> or show the way to one who had gone astray, or bring an oil-lamp into
> the darkness so that those with vision might see material shapes—even
> so in many a figure has dhamma been made clear by the reverend Gotama.
> Thus I am going to the reverend Gotama for refuge, to the Dhamma and
> to the Order of monks. May the reverend Gotama accept me as a
> layfollower going for refuge from today forth for as long as life
> lasts.

Some people have confidence to become a lay-disciple and others have
confidence to become a monk, it depends on one’s accumulated
inclinations. There are also people who are inclined to listen, but who
do not gain enough confidence to practise the teachings. It may not be
the right time for them to begin with the development of the Path, but
in a future life they may listen again and then gain enough confidence
to practise the teachings. We should find out for ourselves whether our
confidence is to the degree that we apply the Dhamma we have heard or
not yet. If one has enough confidence one will continue to develop right
understanding until enlightenment is attained and all doubt and wrong
view are eradicated.

There is still another aspect to confidence, saddhā, and that is the
aspect of indriya, controlling faculty. An indriya exercises leadership
over the dhammas it accompanies. There are five wholesome cetasikas,
indriyas, called the “spiritual faculties”, which should be developed.
They are: confidence, energy, mindfulness, concentration and wisdom.
These faculties overcome the defilements which are their opposites.
Confidence governs the accompanying dhammas, citta and cetasikas, in its
quality of purifying and of confiding in kusala. It overcomes lack of
confidence in kusala. Without confidence kusala citta and its
accompanying cetasikas could not arise. The *Atthasālinī* (I, Part IV,
Chapter I, 119) states:

> “From the overcoming of lack of faith, faith is a controlling faculty
> in the sense of predominance, or in its characteristic of decision it
> exercises lordship (over associated states).”

When the “spiritual faculties” have been developed they become “powers”
or “strengths” (balas). Then they have become firm and unshakable, they
cannot be shaken by the defilements which are their opposites. The same
cetasikas which can be considered under the aspect of indriya can also
be considered under the aspect of power. We read in the *Dhammasangaṇi*
about confidence as faculty, indriya, and as power, bala:

> The faith which on that occasion is a trusting in, the professing
> confidence in, the sense of assurance, faith, faith as a faculty and
> as a power—this is the faith that there then is.

The *Atthasālinī* (I, Part IV, Chapter II, 145) explains this passage
and states that assurance is abundant assurance in the virtues of the
Buddha. Such assurance is not based on mere theoretical understanding of
the Buddha’s teachings. There can only be abundant confidence in the
Buddha’s virtues when right understanding of realities has been
developed.

Those who want to develop calm to the degree of jhāna have to develop
the five “spiritual faculties”. We read in the *Visuddhimagga* (IV,
45-49), in the section on the conditions necessary for the attainment of
jhāna, that the faculties, indriyas, have to be “balanced”. When any one
of them is too strong and other faculties weak, they cannot perform
their functions. The faculty of faith has to be balanced with the
faculty of wisdom:

> …For one strong in faith and weak in understanding has confidence
> uncritically and groundlessly. One strong in understanding and weak in
> faith errs on the side of cunning and is as hard to cure as one sick
> of a disease caused by medicine. With the balancing of the two a man
> has confidence only when there are grounds for it…

Further on we read that concentration and faith must be balanced: “One
working on concentration needs strong faith, since it is with such faith
and confidence that he reaches absorption…”

The “spiritual faculties” have to be developed also for the attainment
of enlightenment and they must be balanced. How are the faculties
balanced in vipassanā? One may have confidence in the Buddha’s teachings
but right understanding of realities may not have been developed and
then confidence is not balanced with the other faculties. But when right
understanding of the present moment has been developed, there is also
confidence and this is balanced with understanding and the other
faculties.

When we are forgetful of realities there is no confidence in awareness
of the present moment. This may happen, for example, when we are
listening to the stories other people tell us and we are quite absorbed
in these stories. But sometimes there may be mindfulness of one reality
at a time, for example of sound, and then this can be realized as only a
rūpa, a reality which can be heard, not a voice or a person. At such a
moment there is confidence which sees the value of right understanding.
When we develop right understanding, we do not have to aim at
confidence, it arises already. Confidence grows to the extent that right
understanding develops. Through mindfulness of nāma and rūpa, thus,
through the development of the four “Applications of Mindfulness”
(satipaṭṭhāna) the five spiritual faculties develop together.

As we have seen, when the faculty of confidence has been more developed,
it can become unshakable and firm, it can become a “power” or “strength”
(bala). So long as one has not attained enlightenment confidence can
still be shaken. One may have doubt about the value of the development
of right understanding, doubt about the eightfold Path. The confidence
of the sotāpanna cannot be shaken anymore; he has eradicated doubt. He
has an unshakable confidence in the Buddha, the Dhamma and the Sangha.
At each stage of enlightenment the faculties and thus also confidence
have become more developed. At the moment of the attainment of
arahatship they have reached completion.

As we have seen, one of the proximate causes of confidence is an object
worthy of confidence. The Buddha, the Dhamma and the Sangha are objects
worthy of confidence. So long as we are not ariyans we do not really
understand what enlightenment means; we have only theoretical
understanding about it and thus our knowledge is very limited. We take
our refuge in the Buddha, but our confidence in his virtues cannot be as
strong as the sotāpanna’s confidence. The second Gem in which we take
refuge is the Dhamma. The term “dhamma” has many meanings, it can stand
for the teachings, or for paramattha dhamma, ultimate reality. Seeing
and attachment are real, they are dhammas. We do not take our refuge in
every dhamma. Nibbāna is lokuttara dhamma and this is the second Gem,
the Dhamma we take our refuge in. Also the eight types of lokuttara
cittas which experience nibbāna are included in the second Gem; thus
there are “nine lokuttara dhammas” in which we take our refuge. Again,
our understanding of the second Gem is limited so long as we have not
attained enlightenment. Our confidence in the teachings which lead to
enlightenment cannot be as strong as the sotāpanna’s confidence; he
knows from experience what enlightenment means. The ariyan Sangha is the
third Gem in which we take our refuge. We do not really know what it
means to be an ariyan so long as we are not ariyans ourselves and thus
our confidence in the ariyan Sangha is still weak.

When we realize how weak our confidence still is, we should not become
discouraged. When we think of all the virtues of the ariyan, his
unshakable confidence in wholesomeness, his purity of sīla and his
generosity, we should not forget that it all started with listening to
the Dhamma, considering it and developing right understanding. We read
in the *Middle Length Sayings* (II, no. 70, Kīṭāgiri sutta) that the
Buddha, while he was in Kāsi, said that enlightenment could not be
attained without diligence. He spoke to the monks about people with
different accumulations who attained enlightenment, and then said:

> I, monks, do not say that the attainment of profound knowledge comes
> straightaway; nevertheless, monks, the attainment of profound
> knowledge comes by a gradual training, a gradual doing, a gradual
> course. And how, monks, does the attainment of profound knowledge come
> by means of a gradual training, a gradual doing, a gradual course? As
> to this, monks, one who has faith draws close; drawing close, he sits
> down near by; sitting down near by he lends ear; lending ear he hears
> dhamma; having heard dhamma he remembers it; he tests the meaning of
> the things he has borne in mind; while testing the meaning the things
> are approved of; there being approval of the things
> desire[(158)](#FOOT158) is born; with desire born he makes an effort;
> having made the effort he weighs it up; having weighed it up he
> strives; being self-resolute he realizes himself the highest truth
> itself and, penetrating it by means of wisdom, he sees…

The ariyan is often described as a person who has heard much. He has
listened to Dhamma and has applied what he has heard. If he had been a
passive listener he could not have attained enlightenment. We may wish
to reach the goal without cultivating the right cause which leads to the
goal. If there is no beginning of the development of understanding at
this moment how can we expect the arising of profound wisdom? Realities
such as hardness, feeling or sound appear time and again. If one begins
to be mindful of the reality which appears now, one cultivates the right
conditions for the growth of right understanding. There should be
confidence which is as courageous and determined as the hero who crosses
the flood. Many moments of such courageous determination are needed in
order to realize what one has not yet realized.
