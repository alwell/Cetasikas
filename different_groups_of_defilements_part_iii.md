## Different Groups of Defilements Part III

Defilements can be classified in many different ways and each
classification reminds us of the danger of akusala. There is another
group of defilements which is again completely different, namely the
group of the *latent tendencies* or *anusayas*.

In the *Dhammasangaṇi* the latent tendencies have not been classified as
a group. Only lobha as “latent bias”, anusaya, has been specifically
mentioned among the many aspects of lobha (par1059). The *Atthasālinī*
(II, Part II, Chapter II, 366) comments: “As latent bias greed lies
chronically in us as a strong (tendency)”. There is not only the latent
tendency of lobha, there are seven akusala dhammas which can be
classified as latent tendencies and these lie dormant in us as strong
leanings. We read in the *Book of Analysis* (Vibhaṅga, Chapter 17,
par949) that there are seven anusayas [(140)](#FOOT140):

1.  the latent tendency of lust for sense pleasure (kāmarāgānusaya)
2.  the latent tendency of aversion (paṭighānusaya)
3.  the latent tendency of conceit (mānānusaya)
4.  the latent tendency of wrong view (diṭṭhānusaya)
5.  the latent tendency of doubt (vicikicchānusaya)
6.  the latent tendency of lust for becoming (bhava-rāgānusaya)
7.  the latent tendency of ignorance (avijjānusaya)

The classification of akusala dhammas by way of latent tendencies
reminds us of their stubbornness, their pertinaciousness. The latent
tendencies are like microbes investing the body. They are latent but
they may become active at any moment, when conditions are favourable
[(141)](#FOOT141). Latent tendencies are hard to get rid of.

We read in the *Visuddhimagga* (XXII, 60) about the stubbornness of the
latent tendencies:

> …For it is owing to their inveteracy that they are called inherent
> tendencies (anusaya) since they inhere (anusenti) as cause for the
> arising of greed for sense desires, etc. , again and again.

The latent tendencies are “inveterate”, that is, they are firmly
established, for a long time, obstinate, hard to eradicate.

One may wonder why not all akusala dhammas have been classified as
latent tendencies. Have we not accumulated all akusala dhammas from life
to life? We should note that the seven akusala dhammas which have been
classified as latent tendencies are particularly obstinate and condition
the arising of the other defilements.

So long as latent tendencies have not been eradicated, defilements arise
again and again. For example, when someone is reborn in one of the
brahma-planes, there are no conditions for aversion in that plane.
However, so long as the latent tendency of aversion has not been
eradicated, aversion is bound to arise again when that person is reborn
in one of the sensuous planes, after his lifespan in the brahma-plane
has been terminated.

Latent tendencies are eradicated at different stages of
enlightenment[(142)](#FOOT142). The magga-citta of the sotāpanna
eradicates the latent tendency of wrong view and of doubt and thus these
akusala dhammas can never arise again. The magga-citta of the sakadāgāmī
does not completely eradicate any of the other latent tendencies, but,
it “severs the gross latent bias of sense-desires and the gross latent
bias of aversion”, as the *Atthasālinī* [(143)](#FOOT143) states.

As we have seen, there are many degrees of defilements, they can be
gross or more subtle. The sakadāgāmī still has the latent tendencies of
sensuous desire and aversion, but they have become attenuated.
Therefore, in comparison with the sotāpanna these latent tendencies are
less gross, they are more subtle. The group of latent tendencies as a
whole can be called subtle defilements. They are subtle in so far as
they are latent; they are subtle in comparison with akusala citta rooted
in lobha, dosa or moha, which appears, and which can be called “medium
defilement” and with akusala citta which has the intensity to motivate
evil deeds through body, speech or mind, which can be called “gross
defilement”. However, the term subtle should not mislead us. The latent
tendencies are dangerous, pertinacious, they are hard to eradicate. They
condition the arising of akusala dhammas again and again.

The magga-citta of the anāgāmī eradicates completely the latent
tendencies of sense-desire and aversion, these can never arise again.
However, he has not eradicated all forms of clinging, he still has the
latent tendency of lust for becoming, rebirth which is the result of
jhāna. The magga-citta of the arahat eradicates the latent tendencies of
lust for becoming, of conceit and of ignorance. When there is no more
“soil” for defilements to grow in, the round of becoming comes to an
end.

The *Fetters* or Saṃyojanas are another group of akusala dhammas. The
saṃyojanas “fetter khandhas (in this life) to khandhas (of the next), or
kamma to its fruit[(144)](#FOOT144), or beings to
suffering…(*Visuddhimagga* XXII, 48). Through the fetters we are tied to
the cycle of birth and death [(145)](#FOOT145). In the *Dhammasangaṇi*
(par1113) we find the following classification of ten
fetters[(146)](#FOOT146):

1.  sensuous desire (kāma-rāga)
2.  ill will (vyāpāda)
3.  conceit (māna)
4.  wrong view (diṭṭhi)
5.  doubt (vicikicchā)
6.  clinging to rules and rituals (sīlabbata-parāmāsa)
7.  clinging to rebirth (bhava-rāga)
8.  envy (issā)
9.  stinginess (macchariya)
10. ignorance (avijjā)

In the classifications of the fetters as given above, diṭṭhi has been
classified under two aspects: wrong view and wrong practice (clinging to
rules and rituals). When there is no right practice, the wrong view of
self and other defilements cannot be eradicated and thus we are fettered
to the cycle of birth and death. When there is no mindfulness of one
reality at a time, the nāma or rūpa appearing now, there is no right
practice, one does not develop the eightfold Path. So long as one has
not become a sotāpanna there may be wrong practice.

Envy and stinginess are akusala dhammas which have only been classified
by way of fetters but not in the other groups of defilements. We should
find out whether there is envy when someone else receives a token of
honour we did not receive. Attachment to self conditions coarse akusala
such as jealousy. The sotāpanna who has eradicated the wrong view of
self has also eradicated jealousy as well as stinginess. If we develop
understanding of nāma and rūpa in daily life, we may begin to see that
life is actually one moment of experiencing an object. Sometimes the
object is pleasant, sometimes it is unpleasant, this depends entirely on
conditions. The experience of pleasant objects and unpleasant objects is
conditioned by kamma, by deeds which have been done. If we see life as
different phenomena which each arise because of their own conditions,
there will be less opportunity for jealousy. When we see how we at times
can be overpowered by jealousy and other akusala dhammas we can be
reminded to develop right understanding of nāma and rūpa in order to
eradicate akusala.

There is another way of classifying fetters and this shows us again that
classifications are not rigid. We find for example in the *Book of
Analysis* (Chapter 17, par940)[(147)](#FOOT147) the following
classification of the fetters which makes a distinction between “lower
fetters” and “higher fetters”. There are five lower fetters
(orambhāgiya-saṃyojana) which tie beings to the sensuous planes and five
higher fetters (uddhambhāgiya-saṃyojana) which tie beings to the higher
planes, the rūpa-brahma planes and the arūpa-brahma planes.

The lower fetters are:

-   personality belief (sakkāya-diṭṭhi)
-   doubt (vicikicchā)
-   clinging to rules and rituals (sīlabbata-parāmāsa)
-   sensuous desire (kāma-rāga)
-   ill will (vyāpāda)

The higher fetters are:

-   lust for rebirth in rūpa-brahma planes (rūpa-rāga)
-   lust for rebirth in arūpa-brahma planes (arūpa-rāga)
-   conceit (māna)
-   restlessness (uddhacca)
-   ignorance (avijjā)

In this classification wrong view has been classified as twofold: under
the aspect of personality belief and wrong practice. Clinging has been
classified as threefold: as sensuous desire, as clinging to rebirth
which is the result of rūpa-jhāna and as clinging to rebirth which is
the result of arūpa-jhāna. Envy and stinginess do not occur in this
classification.

The magga-citta of the sotāpanna eradicates the three lower fetters of
personality belief, clinging to rules and rituals (wrong practice) and
doubt. He has not eradicated sensuous desire and ill will, but for him
these are not as gross as in the case of the non-ariyan; they cannot
lead to an unhappy rebirth.

The magga-citta of the sakadāgāmī does not eradicate the fetters of
sensuous desire and ill-will, but they have become attenuated. Paññā has
to be developed to a high degree in order that desire and ill will can
be eradicated. The anāgāmī eradicates both these fetters. He is no
longer tied by the lower fetters, but he is still tied by the higher
fetters. This shows how hard it is to eradicate these fetters. Only the
magga-citta of the arahat can eradicate them. The arahat does not cling
at all, he does not cling to the result of jhāna, he does not cling to
rebirth in any plane of existence. He has no more conceit, restlessness
and ignorance, he has eradicated all akusala dhammas. He has no akusala
citta nor kusala citta, instead he has kiriyacitta which does not
produce any result. The arahat is truly a perfected one, his task has
been fulfilled. He is no longer fettered to the cycle of birth and
death.

Another group of akusala dhammas are the *defilements*, *kilesas*. They
are dirty, unclean, impure; they defile or torment the mind. The
following ten akusala dhammas have been classified as defilements
(*Dhammasangaṇi*, par1229) [(148)](#FOOT148) :

1.  greed (lobha)
2.  hate (dosa)
3.  ignorance (moha)
4.  conceit (māna)
5.  wrong view (diṭṭhi)
6.  doubt (vicikicchā)
7.  sloth (thīna)
8.  restlessness (uddhacca)
9.  shamelessness (ahirika)
10. recklessness (anottappa)

We can use the word defilement or kilesa in a wider sense and then we
mean all akusala dhammas. But when defilements are classified as a
particular group only the above mentioned akusala dhammas are meant.
Torpor (middha), stinginess (macchariya), regret (kukkucca) and envy
(issā) have not been classified in this group. The *Visuddhimagga*
(XXII, 49) states about defilements: “They are so called because they
are themselves defiled and they defile the states associated with them.”

Shamelessness and recklessness which have not been classified in one of
the other groups are classified among the defilements. Shamelessness has
no shame of akusala and recklessness does not fear its consequences.
They arise with each akusala citta, they defile citta and the
accompanying cetasikas. There are many degrees of shamelessness and
recklessness. Some people are ashamed of gross defilements and they fear
their consequences, but they are not ashamed of akusala citta which is
not of the intensity to motivate unwholesome deeds. For example, when we
are at this moment forgetful of realities such as seeing or hearing it
is evident that we have no shame of neglectfulness with regard to the
development of right understanding.

Defilements are eradicated at the different stages of enlightenment. The
magga-citta of the sotāpanna eradicates wrong view and doubt. The
magga-citta of the anāgāmī eradicates hate. The anāgāmī does not cling
to sensuous objects but he may still cling to rebirth which is the
result of jhāna. Since this kind of clinging is, in this group of
akusala dhammas, included in the defilement of greed, lobha, he has not
eradicated this defilement. The magga-citta of the arahat eradicates the
defilements of greed, ignorance, conceit, sloth, restlessness,
shamelessness and recklessness. The arahat is free from all defilements.

Summarizing the different groups of akusala dhammas, they are:

1.  cankers, āsavas
2.  floods, oghas
3.  yokes, yoghas
4.  ties, ganthas
5.  ways of clinging, upādānas
6.  hindrances, nīvaraṇas
7.  latent tendencies, anusayas
8.  fetters, saṃyojanas
9.  defilements, kilesas

Attachment, lobha, occurs in all of these groups and wrong view, diṭṭhi,
in all groups except the group of the hindrances. This reminds us of our
entanglement by lobha and diṭṭhi. Lobha and diṭṭhi occur sometimes
within one group more than once, under different aspects. We should know
what the object of lobha is in each classification, because sometimes
lobha stands for sensuous clinging and sometimes clinging to the result
of jhāna has been included as well.

Each of these groups can remind us of the dangers of akusala dhamma. For
example, the classification by way of ties (ganthas) or of fetters
(saṃyojanas) can remind us of the danger of being tied or chained to the
cycle of birth and death. We are overcome by the cankers and by the
floods, we are chained and fettered, but we may not realize it. The
classification by ways of clinging (upādānas) shows us how we are in the
grip of clinging to objects which are experienced through the senses and
of clinging to the self. We forget that attachment cannot lead to
happiness, that it leads to sorrow.

In the *Kindred Sayings* (II, Niddāna-vagga, Chapter XVII, Kindred
Sayings on Gain and Favours) we read in fortythree suttas that the
Buddha reminded the monks of the danger of attachment to gains, favours
and flattery. We read for example in the first sutta of this section
(par1, Dire) that the Buddha said to the monks:

> Dire, monks, are gains, favours and flattery, a bitter, harsh obstacle
> in the way of arriving at uttermost safety.
>
> Wherefore, monks, thus should you train yourselves:-
>
> “When gains, favour and flattery come to us, we will put them aside,
> nor when they come shall they take lasting hold on our hearts.”

Why did the Buddha stress so repeatedly the danger of attachment to
gains, favours and flattery? Because our happiness seems to depend
entirely on the getting of the pleasant “worldly conditions”. Don’t they
play an all-important role in our life? We want to be treated well by
others, we consider ourselves very important and we forget that gain,
loss, honour and dishonour are dependant on conditions, that they are
beyond control. We cannot exert control over what will happen next: gain
or loss, honour or dishonour. The Buddha explained that desire is the
root of sorrow, but we may not fully understand this truth. Only right
understanding which has been developed can see the truth of the Buddha’s
words.

Precise understanding of all the different phenomena of our life has to
be developed. We usually pay attention only to pleasant or unpleasant
sense objects, and we tend to overlook realities such as seeing or
hearing. We should remember that when we experience praise or blame
there are many different types of cittas. The cittas which see or hear
pleasant or unpleasant objects are vipākacittas, conditioned by kamma
which was committed already, and we cannot prevent them from arising.
The moment of vipākacitta such as hearing which merely experiences sound
is different from akusala citta which may arise shortly afterwards and
which experiences sound in an unwholesome way, for example with
attachment or aversion. Then there are other processes of cittas, cittas
which may think in an unwholesome way about concepts. We may, for
example, think for a long time about the wrongs other people committed
towards us. If one is ignorant of vipāka one will be inclined to
continually blame others for unpleasant objects which are received
through the senses. We should know vipākacittas such as seeing and
hearing as well as the other types of cittas. When we realize how
ignorant we still are we will be reminded to go on developing right
understanding. Through right understanding we will gradually learn to
attach less importance to “self”, and as a consequence we will be
inclined to think more of other people’s happiness instead of our own
happiness.

In the *Kindred Sayings* (V, Mahā-vagga, Kindred Sayings on the Way,
Book I, Chapter VIII) we read about groups of akusala dhammas and their
eradication. We read, for example, about the floods:

> Monks, there are four floods. What four? The flood of sensual desire,
> the flood of becoming, the flood of view, the flood of nescience.
> These are the four. It is for the full comprehension, realization,
> wearing down and abandoning of these four floods that the ariyan
> eightfold way must be cultivated.

We read the same about other groups of defilements, such as the yokes,
ties, latent tendencies, hindrances, the lower fetters and the higher
fetters. We read at the end of this section, after the summing up of the
higher fetters:

> …It is for the full comprehension, the realization, wearing down and
> abandoning of these five fetters of the higher sort that the ariyan
> eightfold way must be cultivated. …And how does a monk cultivate the
> ariyan eightfold way?
>
> Herein a monk cultivates right view, right thinking, right speech,
> right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, right
> concentration, that ends in the restraint of lust, of hatred, of
> illusion; that plunges into the deathless, that has the deathless for
> its goal, that ends in the deathless; that flows to nibbāna, that
> slides to nibbāna, that tends to nibbāna.
>
> It is for the full comprehension, for the realization, for the wearing
> out and abandoning of these five fetters of the higher sort, monks,
> that this ariyan eightfold way must be cultivated.

Before there can be abandoning of akusala dhammas, there must be right
understanding of all nāmas and rūpas of our daily life.

### Questions

1.  We have accumulated all kinds of akusala, from life to life. Why
    then are there only seven akusala dhammas which are classified as
    latent tendencies?
2.  Who has eradicated the five lower fetters?
3.  Who has eradicated the five higher fetters?
