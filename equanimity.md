Equanimity (tatramajjhattatā) 
-----------------------------


 ``` 
 The good give up (attachment for) everything; 
 the saintly prattle not with thoughts 
 of craving: 
 whether affected by happiness or by 
 pain, 
 the wise show neither elation nor depression. 
 
 Dhammapada (Chapter VI, The Wise, vs. 83)

We are still susceptible to elation and depression. Those who have
highly developed wisdom, the arahats, are not susceptible to elation nor
depression, they have equanimity instead. There are many kinds and
degrees of this quality and the arahat has the highest degree.

Equanimity, evenmindedness or balance of mind (in Pāli:
tatramajjhattatā), is one of the nineteen sobhana cetasikas which
accompany each sobhana citta. It is not easy to know the characteristic
of equanimity. We may think that there is equanimity whenever there is
neither like nor dislike of what we see, hear or experience through the
other senses, but at such moments there may be ignorance instead of
equanimity. We may confuse equanimity and indifferent feeling, but these
are different cetasikas; equanimity is not feeling, the cetasika which
is vedanā. The *Visuddhimagga* (XIV, 153) states about equanimity:

It has the characteristic of conveying citta and cetasikas evenly. Its
function is to prevent deficiency and excess, or its function is to
inhibit partiality. It is manifested as neutrality. It should be
regarded as like a conductor (driver) who looks on with equanimity on
thoroughbreds progressing evenly.

The *Atthasālinī* (I, Book I, Part IV, Chapter I, 133) gives a similar
definition. When there is equanimity there is neither elation nor
depression. The object which is experienced is viewed with impartiality
and neutrality, just as a charioteer treats with impartiality his
well-trained horses. Equanimity effects the balance of the citta and the
other cetasikas it arises together with. There is no balance of mind
when akusala citta arises, when we are cross, greedy, avaricious or
ignorant. Whereas when we are generous, observe morality (sīla), develop
calm or develop right understanding of nāma and rūpa, there is balance
of mind.

There are different forms and degrees of equanimity. If we know more
about them it will help us to understand the characteristic of
equanimity. The *Visuddhimagga* (IV, 156-172) deals with different kinds
of equanimity[(169)](#FOOT169).

One of the aspects of equanimity mentioned by the *Visuddhimagga* is
*equanimity as specific neutrality*. As we have read in the definition
of equanimity given by the *Visuddhimagga*, it has the characteristic of
conveying (carrying on) evenly citta and the accompanying cetasikas, and
its function is the preventing of deficiency and excess, or the
inhibiting of partiality. Equanimity effects the balance of the citta
and the cetasikas it arises together with, so that there is neither
deficiency nor excess of any one among them. When the citta is kusala
citta it is always accompanied by equanimity which effects the balance
of the citta and the accompanying cetasikas. Kusala citta is also
accompanied, for example, by energy or effort, viriya, which is
balanced: there is neither deficiency nor excess of it, and thus it can
assist the kusala citta in accomplishing its task. All cetasikas play
their own part in assisting the kusala citta and equanimity has its own
specific function in effecting mental balance.

When we abstain from wrong action or wrong speech there is equanimity
with the kusala citta. When others, for example, treat us badly or use
abusive speech, there can be equanimity, and then there is no
impatience, intolerance or anxiety about our own well-being. With
evenmindedness one can abstain from answering back harshly or from acts
of vengeance. Equanimity is one of the “perfections” the Bodhisatta
developed together with right understanding for innumerable lives. When
there is mindfulness of nāma and rūpa appearing now there is patience
and equanimity, even if the object which is experienced is unpleasant.

There are several other kinds of equanimity. There is equanimity in
samatha and equanimity in vipassanā. When calm is developed or when
there is right understanding of the present moment there is equanimity
which performs its function. The *Visuddhimagga* mentions some aspects
of equanimity which are equanimity of samatha and some which are
equanimity of vipassanā.

One of the aspects of equanimity mentioned by the *Visuddhimagga* is
equanimity as one of the “divine abidings” (brahmavihāra-upekkhā) and
this is developed in samatha (Vis. IV, 158). As we have seen, there are
four “divine abidings” which are objects of calm: loving kindness,
compassion, sympathetic joy and equanimity.

When loving kindness is developed one wishes that other beings may be
happy. When compassion is developed one wishes beings to be free from
suffering. When sympathetic joy is developed one wishes beings’ success.
When equanimity is developed one does not think of promoting other
beings’ happiness, alleviating their misery or wishing their success,
but one views them with impartiality.

We read in the *Visuddhimagga* (IX, 96) about the divine abiding of
equanimity:

> Equanimity is characterized as promoting the aspect of neutrality
> towards beings. Its function is to see equality in beings. It is
> manifested as the quieting of resentment and approval. Its proximate
> cause is seeing ownership of deeds (kamma) thus: “Beings are owners of
> their deeds. Whose (if not theirs) is the choice by which they will
> become happy, or will get free from suffering, or will not fall away
> from the success they have reached?” It succeeds when it makes
> resentment and approval subside, and it fails when it produces the
> equanimity of unknowing, which is that (worldly-minded indifference of
> ignorance) based on the home-life.

Ignorance is called the “near enemy” of equanimity, because one may
think that there is equanimity when there is actually ignorance. Its far
enemies are greed and resentment. When there is attachment or aversion
there cannot be equanimity at the same time.

If one understands the characteristic of equanimity it can be developed
in daily life and condition moments of calm. Sometimes people may be
beyond any help, but when we remember that unpleasant results in life
they receive are conditioned by kamma, that people are “heirs” to kamma,
it will prevent us from being distressed. Sadness about other people’s
suffering is not helpful, neither for ourselves nor for others, whereas
when there is equanimity we can be of comfort to others. Those who have
accumulated conditions for the development of calm to the degree of
jhāna can, with the divine abiding of equanimity as meditation subject,
attain jhāna[(170)](#FOOT170).

The *Visuddhimagga* mentions other aspects of equanimity, which pertain
to samatha, namely the specific quality of equanimity in the third stage
of rūpa-jhāna (of the fourfold system and the fourth stage of the
fivefold system[(171)](#FOOT171)), which is called *equanimity of jhāna*
(jhāna-upekkhā)[(172)](#FOOT172), and equanimity in the highest stage of
rūpa-jhāna, which is called *purifying equanimity*[(173)](#FOOT173). At
each subsequent stage of jhāna the jhānacitta and its accompanying
cetasikas are calmer, purer and more refined.

Each of the aspects of equanimity mentioned by the *Visuddhimagga* is
different. Equanimity as “specific neutrality”, equanimity as one of the
divine abidings, equanimity of jhāna and purifying equanimity are all
different aspects of tatramajjhattatā.

The *Visuddhimagga* also mentions aspects of equanimity of vipassanā.
*Equanimity as a factor of enlightenment* is an aspect of equanimity in
vipassanā mentioned by the *Visuddhimagga* (IV, 159). There are seven
factors of enlightenment (sambojjhanga): mindfulness (sati),
investigation of Dhamma (Dhamma vicaya, which is paññā), energy
(viriya), enthusiasm (pīti), calm (passaddhi), concentration (samādhi)
and equanimity (upekkhā). Equanimity is in this case again the cetasika
tatramajjhattatā. When the enlightenment factors have been developed
they lead to enlightenment. They are not developed separately, but they
are developed together with satipaṭṭhāna. The enlightenment factor of
equanimity performs its own function while it accompanies citta and the
other cetasikas. We read in the *Visuddhimagga* (IV, 159) about the
enlightenment factor of equanimity: “He develops the equanimity
enlightenment factor depending on relinquishment”[(174)](#FOOT174). When
right understanding sees the unsatisfactoriness of all conditioned
realities which arise and then fall away, there will be indifference
towards them.

When satipaṭṭhāna is being developed we do not have to aim at the
development of equanimity because it develops together with insight. The
enlightenment factors reach completion through satipaṭṭhāna. When
conditioned realities have been clearly understood as they are,
enlightenment can be attained.

There is yet another aspect of equanimity mentioned by the
*Visuddhimagga* and this is the *sixfold equanimity* which is actually
the equanimity which has reached completion at the attainment of
arahatship. We read in the *Visuddhimagga* (IV, 157):

> Herein, six-factored equanimity is a name for the equanimity in one
> whose cankers are destroyed. It is the mode of non-abandonment of the
> natural state of purity when desirable or undesirable objects of the
> six kinds come into focus in the six doors described thus: “Here a
> bhikkhu whose cankers are destroyed is neither glad nor sad on seeing
> a visible object with the eye: he dwells in equanimity, mindful and
> fully aware.” (*Gradual Sayings*, Book of the Sixes, Chapter I, par
> 1).

The arahat has a perfect balance of mind. He is unruffled by the worldly
conditions of gain and loss, praise and blame, honour and dishonour,
well-being and misery. To us the sixfold equanimity of the arahat seems
to be far off. We should remember that this equanimity can only be
achieved by understanding, paññā, which has been developed stage by
stage. It is useless to have wishful thinking about this perfect
equanimity. It cannot be realized by longing for it. The fact that this
equanimity is sixfold can remind us that only when understanding of what
appears through the six doors has been developed can there be equanimity
towards all objects.

Understanding can be developed now, when there is an object presenting
itself through one of the six doors. Sometimes the object is pleasant,
sometimes unpleasant. When understanding has not been developed it is
difficult to be “balanced”, to “stay in the middle”, without attachment,
without aversion. We may tell ourselves time and again that life is only
nāma and rūpa, conditioned realities which are beyond control, but we
are still impatient and we are still disturbed by the events of life.
However, when there is mindfulness, for example, of visible object,
understanding can realize it as a rūpa which appears through the
eye-door, not a thing, not a person. When there is mindfulness of
seeing, understanding can realize it as only an experience, a type of
nāma, no self who sees. When realities are clearly known as not a thing,
not a person, thus, as anattā, there will be more even-mindedness and
impartiality towards them. However, this cannot be realized in the
beginning. The arahat has eradicated all defilements and, thus, he can
have equanimity which has reached perfection. He is undisturbed, patient
and always contented.

We read in the *Kindred Sayings* (II, Nidāna-vagga, Chapter XVI, Kindred
Sayings on Kassapa, par 1, Contented) about the arahat Kassapa who was
always contented. We read that the Buddha, while he was staying at
Sāvatthī, said to the monks:

Contented, monks, is this Kassapa with no matter what robe. He commends
contentment with no matter what robe, nor because of a robe does he
commit anything that is unseemly or unfit. If he has gotten no robe, he
is not perturbed; if he has gotten a robe, he enjoys it without clinging
or infatuation, committing no fault, discerning danger, wise as to
escape[(175)](#FOOT175).

Even so is this Kassapa contented with no matter what alms, with no
matter what lodging, with no matter what equipment in medicines.

We then read that the Buddha exhorted the monks to train themselves
likewise. We can train ourselves by being mindful of whatever nāma or
rūpa appears now. Kassapa had developed the right conditions leading to
perfect equanimity.
