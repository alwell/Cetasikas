Enthusiasm (pīti)
-----------------

Pīti, translated as enthusiasm, zest or rapture, is another cetasika
among the six “particulars” which arise with cittas of the four jātis
but not with every citta. Pīti can be kusala, akusala, vipāka or kiriya.

When we think of enthusiasm we presume that it is always kusala. We
praise people who are enthusiastic. However, when we study the
Abhidhamma we learn that enthusiasm is not always kusala, that it arises
also with akusala cittas. There are many more akusala cittas in our life
than kusala cittas and thus, when there is enthusiasm it is more often
akusala than kusala. Don’t we often take for kusala what is in fact
akusala ? Through the study of the Abhidhamma we will have more
understanding of kusala and akusala and of the different conditions for
their arising.

The *Visuddhimagga* (IV, 94) gives the following definition of pīti:

> …It refreshes (pīṇayati, gladdens, satisfies), thus it is happiness
> (pīti)[(64)](#FOOT64). It has the characteristic of
> satisfaction[(65)](#FOOT65) (sampiyāna). Its function is to refresh
> the body and the mind; or its function is to pervade (thrill with
> rapture). It is manifested as elation…

The *Atthasālinī* ( I, Part IV, Chapter 1, 115) gives a similar
definition of pīti[(66)](#FOOT66) .

> Pīti takes an interest in the object which citta cognizes and which is
> also experienced by the accompanying cetasikas. It is satisfied,
> delighted with the object and it “refreshes” citta and the
> accompanying cetasikas.

In the case of the kāmāvacara cittas (cittas of the sense-sphere) pīti
arises with the cittas which are *accompanied by pleasant feeling*
(somanassa). Thus, whenever there is somanassa, there is also pīti. Pīti
is not the same as pleasant feeling, its characteristic and function are
different. Pīti is not feeling, vedanākkhandha, but *saṅkhārakkhandha*
(the khandha which includes all cetasikas except vedanā and saññā).

Pleasant feeling experiences the flavour of the object, its function is
to exploit in one way or other the desirable aspect of the object (Vis.
XIV, 128). Pīti does not feel, its characteristic is, as we have seen,
satisfaction and its function is refreshing or invigorating body and
mind, or to pervade them with rapture. Pīti takes an interest in the
object and is delighted with it, it has its own specific function while
it assists the citta; its function is different from the function of
feeling.

The *Visuddhimagga* (IV, 100) explains in the section on the first jhāna
the difference between pleasant feeling (sukha, translated here as
“bliss”) and pīti (translated here as “happiness”) which are both
jhāna-factors. We read:

> And whenever the two are associated, happiness (pīti) is the
> contentedness at getting a desirable object, and bliss (sukha) is the
> actual experience of it when got. Where there is happiness there is
> bliss; but where there is bliss there is not necessarily
> happiness[(67)](#FOOT67). Happiness is included in the
> saṅkhārakkhandha; bliss is included in the vedanākkhandha. If a man
> exhausted in a desert saw or heard about a pond on the edge of a wood,
> he would have happiness; if he went into the wood’s shade and used the
> water, he would have bliss…

The different words which are used to describe pleasant feeling and
enthusiasm and also the above-quoted simile can help us to have
theoretical knowledge of these two realities. If there is mindfulness of
realities when they appear, a more precise understanding of their
characteristics can be developed. However, we should not try to “catch”
particular realities, it depends on conditions of which reality sati is
aware.

As we have seen, in the case of the kāmāvacara cittas, pīti arises with
the cittas which are accompanied by pleasant feeling. Whenever there is
interest in the object and delight with it there is also pleasant
feeling; in such cases there cannot be indifferent feeling or unpleasant
feeling.

In the case of akusala cittas, pīti arises with the types of
lobha-mūla-cittas which are accompanied by pleasant
feeling[(68)](#FOOT68). When the lobha-mūla-citta is accompanied by
pleasant feeling, the lobha is more intense than when it is accompanied
by indifferent feeling. Pīti which arises together with lobha-mūla-citta
accompanied by pleasant feeling takes an interest in the desirable
object, it is delighted, thrilled with it. For example, when we have
thoroughly enjoyed listening to beautiful music we may applaud with
great enthusiasm. When we admire a musician, a painter or a famous
sportsman, there may be many moments of lobha-mūla-citta with pīti.
Whenever we are attached to an object with pleasant feeling, there is
also pīti. The object may be a pleasant sight, a beautiful sound, a
fragrant odour, a delicious flavour, a pleasant tangible object or an
agreeable object experienced through the mind-door. There are many
moments of akusala pīti we are not aware of.

Pīti does not arise with dosa-mūla-citta. When dosa-mūla-citta arises,
the citta dislikes the object and then there cannot be at the same time
a pleasurable interest. Pīti does not arise either with moha-mūla-citta;
at the moment of moha-mūla-citta there is no enthusiasm.

As regards ahetuka cittas[(69)](#FOOT69), only the two types which are
accompanied by pleasant feeling arise with pīti: one type of
santīraṇa-citta which is kusala vipāka and investigates an
extraordinarily pleasant object[(70)](#FOOT70) and the
hasituppāda-citta, the smile-producing consciousness of the
arahat[(71)](#FOOT71).

When there is seeing, which is one of the dvi-pañcaviññāṇas
(sense-cognitions), there is no delight or enthusiasm about visible
object, seeing merely sees it. If visible object is an extraordinarily
pleasant object, the santīraṇa-citta in that process which investigates
visible object is accompanied by pleasant feeling and pīti. As regards
the *kāmāvacara sobhana cittas* (beautiful cittas of the sense-sphere),
only the types of citta which are accompanied by pleasant feeling arise
with pīti. When we, with generosity and full of joy, help someone else,
the kusala citta is accompanied by pleasant feeling and also by pīti
which invigorates body and mind. Even if there was tiredness before, it
is gone; one is refreshed. The same may happen when one reads a sutta
with kusala citta accompanied by joy and enthusiasm. At such a moment
one is not bored or tired, there is pīti which takes a pleasurable
interest in the object.

Sometimes we are full of joy and enthusiasm while we help others, while
we give something away or while we are performing other ways of kusala,
but it is not always possible to have joy and enthusiasm at such
moments. There are also moments of kusala citta accompanied by
indifferent feeling, upekkhā, and then there is no pīti. It depends on
conditions whether pīti arises or not. When one has great confidence in
kusala and sees the benefit of it there are conditions for the arising
of joy and enthusiasm while applying oneself to it. When kusala citta
with pleasant feeling arises the accompanying pīti invigorates the citta
and the other cetasikas. Viriya, for example, is intensified by pīti. We
may be able to notice that, when there is joy and enthusiasm for kusala,
we also have more energy to perform it.

There is another aspect of pīti: it can become an *enlightenment
factor*. The other enlightenment factors are, as we have seen,
mindfulness, investigation of the Dhamma (dhamma vicaya), energy
(viriya), calm (passaddhi), concentration (samādhi) and equanimity
(upekkhā)[(72)](#FOOT72) . When the enlightenment factors have been
developed through satipaṭṭhāna, they lead to the realization of the four
noble Truths. When we have just started to be mindful of nāma and rūpa,
we cannot expect the enlightenment factors to be developed yet. They
will develop through satipaṭṭhāna.

The *Atthasālinī* (75) mentions the following factors which are
conducive to the arising of the enlightenment factor of pīti:

> …recollection of the Buddha, the Dhamma and the Sangha, of sīla, of
> generosity, of devas, of peace (nibbāna), avoidance of rough (i.e.
> ill-tempered persons), serving meek persons, reflection on a Suttanta
> which instills confidence and a tendency to all this.

When we read a sutta, ponder over it and test the meaning by being
mindful of the realities the Buddha taught time and again, we can prove
the truth of his teachings. Thus our confidence in the Buddha, the
Dhamma and the Sangha can grow and we will be inspired to continue to
develop the eightfold Path. There can be conditions for the arising of
enthusiasm which invigorates citta and the accompanying cetasikas. Also
pīti can be object of mindfulness so that paññā can see it as it is, as
not self. We should remember that without the development of
satipaṭṭhāna the enlightenment factor of pīti and also the other
enlightenment factors cannot develop.

We read in the “Mahānāma-sutta” (*Gradual Sayings*, Book of the Sixes,
Chapter I, par10) that the Buddha recommended Mahānāma to recollect the
Buddha, the Dhamma, the Sangha, sīla, generosity and devas (their good
qualities). According to the *Visuddhimagga* Mahānāma was a sotāpanna,
thus, he had right understanding of nāma and rūpa and he did not take
any reality for self. We read:

> …Mahānāma, what time the ariyan disciple minds the Tathāgata, his
> heart is never overwhelmed by passion, never overwhelmed by hatred,
> never overwhelmed by delusion; then, verily, is the way of his heart
> made straight because of the Tathāgata. And with his heart’s ways
> straightened, Mahānāma, the ariyan disciple becomes zealous of the
> goal, zealous of Dhamma, wins the joy that is linked to Dhamma; and of
> his joy zest (pīti) is born; when his mind is rapt in zest, his whole
> being becomes calm; calm in being, he experiences ease; and of him who
> dwells at ease the heart is composed.
>
> Mahānāma, of this ariyan disciple it is said: Among uneven folk he
> lives evenly; among troubled folk he lives untroubled; with the ear
> for Dhamma won, he makes become the ever minding of the Buddha.

The same is said with regard to the other recollections. According to
the *Visuddhimagga* (VII, 121) only the ariyan disciple can cultivate
the above mentioned subjects with success, since the non-ariyan cannot
really fathom the meaning of these subjects. If one has not attained
enlightenment, how could one know what it means to be enlightened and
how could one clearly understand the meaning of “Buddha”? Nevertheless,
also the non-ariyan can think of the Buddha with confidence and then
pīti may arise as well.

We cannot induce the arising of kusala pīti, it can only arise because
of its own conditions. Shortly after kusala pīti has arisen and fallen
away, attachment is bound to arise. We may feel very satisfied about
“our kusala” and we may find it very important to have pīti. We may
think that it can last, but in reality it falls away immediately. It is
essential to realize the difference between kusala citta and akusala
citta; thus we will see that there are not kusala cittas all the time,
even when we think that we are performing kusala. We may expect pleasant
things from other people, we like to be praised by them, we want to show
others our good qualities and our knowledge, or we are attached to the
company of people. Defilements are so deeply rooted and they arise
whenever there is an opportunity for their arising. There are many
objects which can condition lobha and lobha can be accompanied by
somanassa and pīti. Enthusiasm which is unwholesome can arise very
shortly after enthusiasm which is wholesome and it is hard to know their
difference. We may find it discouraging to discover that there are many
more akusala cittas than kusala cittas, but at the moment of knowing
akusala citta as it is there is right understanding. At such a moment
the citta is kusala citta and there is no aversion nor feeling of
discouragement.

Not only mahā-kusala cittas, kusala cittas of the sense-sphere, which
are accompanied by somanassa arise with pīti, but also the
mahā-vipākacittas and the mahā-kiriyacittas which are accompanied by
somanassa arise with pīti. As regards mahā-vipākacittas, these are
produced by kamma, and thus it depends on the kamma which produces the
mahā-vipākacitta whether it is accompanied by somanassa and pīti or not.
Among those who are reborn with mahā-vipākacitta, some are born with
somanassa and pīti, others with upekkhā and in that case there is no
pīti. If one is born with somanassa and pīti, all bhavanga-cittas of
that life and also the cuti-citta (dying-consciousness) are accompanied
by somanassa and pīti as well[(73)](#FOOT73).

Pīti has many intensities. The *Visuddhimagga* (IV, 94) and the
*Atthasālinī* (I, Part IV, Chapter 1, 115,116) explain that there are
*five kinds of pīti.* We read in the *Visuddhimagga*:

> …But it is of five kinds as minor happiness, momentary happiness,
> showering happiness, uplifting happiness, and pervading (rapturous)
> happiness.
>
> Herein, minor happiness is only able to raise the hairs on the body.
> Momentary happiness is like flashes of lightning at different moments.
> Showering happiness breaks over the body again and again like waves on
> the sea shore.
>
> Uplifting happiness can be powerful enough to levitate the body and
> make it spring into the air…
>
> But when pervading (rapturous happiness) arises, the whole body is
> completely pervaded, like a filled bladder, like a rock cavern invaded
> by a huge inundation (IV, 98).

Pīti is able to condition bodily phenomena. The “uplifting happiness”
which is the fourth kind of pīti can even levitate the body. One example
given by the *Visuddhimagga* and the *Atthasālinī* is the case of a
young woman whose parents did not allow her to go to the monastery to
listen to the Dhamma. She looked at the shrine which was lit by
moonlight, saw people worshipping and circumambulating the shrine and
heard the chanting. Then “uplifting happiness” made her jump into the
air and arrive at the monastery before her parents.

In the case of kāmāvacara cittas, pīti always arises together with
somanassa. In the case of the jhāna-cittas, this is not always so. Pīti
is one of the *jhāna-factors* which are developed in samatha in order to
inhibit the hindrances[(74)](#FOOT74). Pīti inhibits the hindrance which
is ill-will (vyāpāda). When there is delight in a meditation subject
there is no ill-will or boredom. As we just read, there are five kinds
of pīti with different intensities. The fifth kind of pīti, the
“pervading happiness”, which has the greatest intensity, is the “root of
absorption” and “comes by growth into association with absorption” (Vis.
IV, 99).

At the first stage of rūpa-jhāna all five jhāna-factors arise with the
jhānacitta. At each of the higher stages of jhāna the jhānacitta becomes
more refined and more tranquil, and the jhāna-factors are successively
abandoned. At the second stage (of the five-fold system) vitakka is
abandoned and at the third stage vicāra. At that stage there are three
jhāna-factors remaining: pīti, happy feeling (sukha) and concentration
(samādhi). At the fourth stage pīti has been abandoned but happy feeling
still arises. In the case of the kāmāvacara cittas, pīti arises whenever
there is pleasant feeling, but this is not so in the case of the
jhāna-citta of the fourth stage of jhāna. The jhānacitta without pīti is
more tranquil, more refined. The kind of pīti which has been abandoned
at this stage is the “pervading happiness” which is of the highest
intensity. The person who has experienced this kind of pīti and is able
to forego it is worthy of praise as stated by the *Atthasālinī* (I, Part
V, Chapters 111, 175).

At the highest stage of rūpa-jhāna (the fourth of the four-fold system
and the fifth of the five-fold system) the jhāna-factor of sukha has
been abandoned and pīti does not arise either at this stage. As regards
arūpāvacara cittas, they are of the same type as the rūpāvacara cittas
of the highest stage of rūpa-jhāna, and thus they are not accompanied by
pīti. As regards lokuttara cittas, they are not always accompanied by
pīti, this depends on different conditions[(75)](#FOOT75) .

There are many different kinds of pīti as it accompanies different types
of citta. The pīti which accompanies lobha-mūla-citta is entirely
different from the pīti which accompanies kusala citta. The pīti which
accompanies jhānacitta is again very different. As we have seen, the
“pervading happiness”, the fifth kind of pīti which is of the highest
degree, is the “root of absorption”. Pīti which is an enlightenment
factor and which develops through mindfulness of nāma and rūpa is
different again from all other kinds. We read in the *Kindred Sayings
(IV*, Saḷāyatana-vagga, Part II, Kindred Sayings about Feeling, Chapter
III, par29, Purified and free from carnal taint) about “zest”, pīti,
that is carnal, pīti that is not carnal and pīti that is still less
carnal:

> And what, monks, is the zest that is carnal?
>
> There are five sensual elements, monks. What five? Objects cognizable
> by the eye, objects desirable, pleasant, delightful and dear,
> passion-fraught, inciting to lust…There are objects cognizable by the
> ear…the nose…the tongue…There are things cognizable by the body,
> tangibles, desirable, pleasant… These, monks, are the five sensual
> elements. Whatsoever zest, monks, arises owing to these five, that is
> called “zest that is carnal”.

We then read about the “ zest that is not carnal”, which is pīti
accompanying the jhānacitta. At the moment of jhānacitta carnal zest is
temporarily subdued, one is not infatuated with the five “sensual
elements”. We read about the “zest that is still less carnal” than the
other kinds:

> …And what monks, is the zest that is still less carnal than the other?
>
> That zest which arises in a monk who has destroyed the
> āsavas[(76)](#FOOT76), who can look upon his heart as released from
> lust—that zest, monks, is called “the zest that is still less carnal
> than the other”.

The same is said about pleasure, indifference and “release”, which can
be carnal, not carnal and still less carnal. The term “still less
carnal” refers to the arahat who has eradicated all forms of attachment
so that it never arises again. This sutta reminds us again to be aware
of the realities appearing through the different doorways, one at a
time. We are usually so absorbed in people and things that we forget
that they are not realities, only concepts. It is not a person which is
experienced through the eyes, but only a kind of rūpa which is visible
object and does not last. We are infatuated with the objects we
experience and we do not realize when there is “pīti which is carnal”.
Pīti which is carnal can arise on account of all the objects we
experience through the six doors. The sutta illustrates how different
pīti is when it arises with different types of citta. Pīti is
conditioned by the accompanying dhammas and, in its turn, it conditions
the accompanying dhammas. Pīti is saṅkhāra dhamma, not self. We may find
it difficult to know when enthusiasm is wholesome and when it is
unwholesome, but through mindfulness of it when it appears its
characteristic can be known more precisely.
