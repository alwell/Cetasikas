The Particulars (pakiṇṇakā)
---------------------------

Seven cetasikas, the *universals* (sabbacitta-sādhāranā), arise with
every citta. Besides these seven cetasikas there are *six cetasikas*,
the *particulars* (pakiṇṇakā)*,* which accompany *cittas of the four
jātis but not every citta.* Both the “universals” and the “particulars”
are of the same jāti as the citta they accompany. Thus, they can be
kusala, akusala, vipāka or kiriya. In addition to the “universals” and
the “particulars” there are also akusala cetasikas which arise only with
akusala cittas and sobhana (beautiful) cetasikas which arise only with
sobhana cittas.
