## Appendix to Chapter 8

### The cittas which are accompanied by vitakka and vicāra 


Both vitakka and vicāra arise with 44 kāmāvacara cittas, the ten
dvi-pañcaviññāṇas are excluded.

As regards jhānacittas, vitakka accompanies only the three rūpāvacara
cittas of the first stage of jhāna, whereas vicāra accompanies the three
rūpāvacara cittas of the first stage of jhāna and the three rūpāvacara
cittas of the second stage of jhāna (of the five-fold system), thus,
altogether six rūpāvacara cittas. In the cases that the function of
paṭisandhi is performed by rūpāvacara vipākacitta, the citta is not
always accompanied by vitakka and vicāra. The rūpāvacara vipākacitta of
the second stage of jhāna (of the five-fold system) is not accompanied
by vitakka, but it is accompanied by vicāra. The rūpāvacara vipākacittas
of the subsequent stages of jhāna are not accompanied by vitakka nor by
vicāra. As regards arūpāvacara cittas, they are of the same type of
citta as the rūpāvacara cittas of the fifth stage of rūpa-jhāna, thus,
they are not accompanied by vitakka nor by vicāra.

When lokuttara jhānacittas, lokuttara cittas accompanied by
jhāna-factors of the different stages of jhāna, are taken into account,
there are forty lokuttara cittas instead of eight. Among these there are
eight lokuttara cittas accompanied by the jhāna-factors of the first
stage of jhāna, thus these are accompanied by both vitakka and vicāra.
The lokuttara cittas accompanied by the jhāna-factors of the second
stage of jhāna (of the five-fold system) are accompanied by vicāra but
not by vitakka. The lokuttara cittas accompanied by the jhāna-factors of
the higher stages of jhāna are without vicāra, since vicāra has been
abandoned at those stages. Thus, there are sixteen lokuttara cittas
accompanied by vicāra. When cittas are counted as 121 (including forty
lokuttara cittas), *vitakka* accompanies:

- 44 kāmāvacara cittas
- 3 rūpāvacara cittas
- 8 lokuttara cittas

—altogether: 55 cittas

As regards *vicāra*, this cetasika accompanies:

- 44 kāmāvacara cittas
- 6 rūpāvacara cittas
- 16 lokuttara cittas

—altogether: 66 cittas
