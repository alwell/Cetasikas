### The Feelings which accompany the different cittas 


*Pleasant bodily feeling* (sukha) arises with only one type of citta:
the body-consciousness (kāya-viññāṇa) which is kusala vipāka. This kind
of kāya-viññāṇa experiences a pleasant tangible object.

*Painful bodily feeling* (dukkha) arises with only one type of citta:
the kāya-viññāṇa which is akusala vipāka. This kind of kāya-viññāṇa
experiences an unpleasant tangible object.

*Happy feeling* (somanassa) arises with cittas of the four jātis but not
with every citta. As regards akusala cittas accompanied by somanassa,
four of the eight types of lobha-mūla-citta are accompanied by
somanassa. The other types of akusala citta are not accompanied by
somanassa.

As regards *ahetuka cittas (cittas without roots, hetus) ,* accompanied
by somanassa, one type of santīraṇa-citta (investigating consciousness)
which is ahetuka kusala vipākacitta, and which investigates an
extraordinarily pleasant object, is accompanied by somanassa. One type
of santīraṇa-citta which is ahetuka kusala vipākacitta and which
investigates a pleasant but not extraordinarily pleasant object, is
accompanied by upekkhā. The santīraṇa-citta which is akusala vipākacitta
is also accompanied by upekkhā. Thus, only one of the three types of
santīraṇa-citta is accompanied by somanassa[(212)](#FOOT212).

The ahetuka kiriyacitta which is the hasituppāda-citta producing the
smile of an arahat[(213)](#FOOT213) is accompanied by somanassa.

Of the kāmāvacara sobhana cittas[(214)](#FOOT214) (beautiful cittas of
the sense-sphere) four types of mahā-kusala cittas, four types of
mahā-vipākacittas and four types of mahā-kiriyacittas are accompanied by
somanassa.

The functions of paṭisandhi (rebirth), bhavanga (life-continuum) and
cuti (dying) can be performed by mahā-vipākacittas[(215)](#FOOT215). In
that case they are the result of kamma performed by mahā-kusala cittas.
Mahā-vipākacittas can be accompanied by somanassa depending on the kamma
which produces them. Those who are born with somanassa have
bhavanga-cittas accompanied by somanassa throughout
life.[(216)](#FOOT216)

As regards rūpāvacara cittas (rūpa-jhānacittas)[(217)](#FOOT217), those
of the first, second, third and fourth stages of jhāna (of the fivefold
system) are accompanied by somanassa. Thus, four rūpāvacara kusala
cittas, four rūpāvacara vipākacittas and four rūpāvacara kiriyacittas
are accompanied by somanassa. The rūpāvacara cittas of the fifth stage
of jhāna are not accompanied by somanassa but by upekkhā.

As regards arūpāvacara cittas (arūpa-jhānacittas), these are of the same
type of citta as the rūpāvacara cittas of the fifth stage of jhāna,
thus, they are not accompanied by somanassa but by upekkhā.

Lokuttara cittas can be accompanied by somanassa or by upekkhā,
depending on conditions. Lokuttara cittas can be classified as eight,
since there are for each of the four stages of enlightenment the
magga-citta (path-consciousness) and its result, the phala-citta
(fruition-consciousness).

People who have accumulated great skill in jhāna and who have also
developed insight, can attain enlightenment with *lokuttara
jhāna-cittas.* The lokuttara jhānacittas, which experience nibbāna, are
accompanied by jhāna-factors of different the stages of jhāna. When
lokuttara jhānacittas are taken into account, there are, instead of
eight lokuttara cittas, forty lokuttara cittas (five times eight, since
there are five stages of jhāna)[(218)](#FOOT218). In the case of the
lokuttara jhānacittas, the accompanying feeling is in accordance with
the accompanying jhāna-factors. In the fifth stage of jhāna there is
upekkhā instead of somanassa, and therefore eight lokuttara jhānacittas,
accompanied by the jhāna-factors of the fifth stage, are not accompanied
by somanassa but by upekkhā. Thus, of the forty lokuttara jhānacittas
thirty-two types are accompanied by somanassa. The feeling which
accompanies the phala-citta (fruition-consciousness, the result of the
magga-citta) is in each case the same type as the feeling which
accompanies the magga-citta.

Summarizing the cittas accompanied by somanassa, they are:

- 4 lobha-mūla-cittas
- 1 santīraṇa-citta
- 1 hasituppāda-citta
- 12 kāmāvacara sobhana cittas
- 12 rūpāvacara cittas
- 32 lokuttara jhānacittas

—altogether: 62

*Domanassa*, unhappy feeling, arises with the two types of
dosa-mūla-citta: one type is asaṅkhārika (unprompted) and one type is
sasaṅkhārika (prompted)[(219)](#FOOT219). Domanassa cannot arise with
other types of citta except these two.

*Upekkhā*, indifferent feeling, can arise with cittas of the four jātis
but it does not arise with every citta. Thus, upekkhā can be kusala,
akusala, vipāka and kiriya. Upekkhā can arise with kāmāvacara cittas
(cittas of the sense-sphere), rūpāvacara cittas, arūpāvacara cittas and
lokuttara cittas.

As regards upekkhā which accompanies akusala cittas, four of the eight
types of lobha-mūla-citta are accompanied by upekkhā. Upekkhā also
accompanies the two types of moha-mūla-citta which are: moha-mūla-citta
accompanied by vicikicchā (doubt) and moha-mūla-citta accompanied by
uddhacca (restlessness)[(220)](#FOOT220).

As regards *ahetuka cittas,* fourteen among the eighteen types are
accompanied by *upekkhā*, namely: twelve ahetuka vipākacittas which are:
four pairs of dvi-pañcaviññāṇas (the pair which is body-consciousness is
excepted), two types of sampaṭicchana-citta (receiving-consciousness),
and two among the three types of santīraṇa
(investigating-consciousness). Only santīraṇa-citta which investigates
an extraordinarily pleasant object is, as we have seen, accompanied by
somanassa. The other two types, one of which is kusala vipāka and one of
which is akusala vipāka, are accompanied by upekkhā[(221)](#FOOT221).

The are two types of ahetuka kiriyacittas which are accompanied by
upekkhā, namely: the pañcadvārāvajjana-citta (the
five-sense-door-adverting-consciousness) and the mano-dvārāvajjana-citta
(the mind-door-adverting-consciousness) which performs, in the
sense-door process, the function of determining the object
(votthapana)[(222)](#FOOT222) and in the mind-door process the function
of adverting to the object through the mind-door. Thus, there are
fourteen types of ahetuka citta in all which are accompanied by upekkhā.

As regards kāmāvacara sobhana cittas, four of the eight mahā-kusala
cittas, four of the eight mahā-vipākacittas and four of the eight
mahā-kiriyacittas are accompanied by upekkhā. Thus, twelve kāmāvacara
sobhana cittas are accompanied by upekkhā.

As regards rūpāvacara cittas, only the rūpāvacara kusala citta, the
rūpāvacara vipāka-citta and the rūpāvacara kiriyacitta of the fifth
stage of jhāna are accompanied by upekkhā; thus, there are three
rūpāvacara cittas accompanied by upekkhā.

The arūpāvacara cittas are the same types of citta as the rūpāvacara
cittas of the fifth stage of jhāna; they all are accompanied by upekkhā.
There are twelve arūpāvacara cittas, namely the arūpāvacara kusala
citta, the arūpāvacara vipākacitta and the arūpāvacara kiriyacitta of
each of the four stages of arūpa-jhāna. At the fourth stage of
arūpa-jhāna, the ’Sphere of Neither Perception nor Non-Perception’,
there is ’neither feeling nor non-feeling’, feeling is present ’in a
subtle state as a residual formation’ (Vis. X, 50)[(223)](#FOOT223).

As regards lokuttara cittas, they can, depending on conditions, be
accompanied by upekkhā. When *lokuttara jhāna-cittas* are taken into
account, the lokuttara cittas accompanied by the jhāna-factors of the
fifth stage of jhāna are accompanied by upekkhā, thus, there are eight
types accompanied by upekkhā.

Summarizing, the cittas accompanied by upekkhā are the following :

- 4 lobha-mūla-cittas
- 2 moha-mūla-cittas
- 1 pañca-dvārāvajjana-citta
- 8 dvi-pañca-viññāṇas
- 2 sampaṭicchana-cittas
- 2 santīraṇa cittas
- 1 mano-dvārāvajjana-citta
- 12 kāmāvacara sobhana cittas
- 3 rūpāvacara cittas
- 12 arūpāvacara cittas
- 8 lokuttara cittas

—altogether: 55 types accompanied by upekkhā.
