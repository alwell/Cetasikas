## Six Pairs of Beautiful Cetasikas

Among the sobhana cetasikas, beautiful cetasikas, which accompany each
sobhana citta, there are twelve cetasikas which are classified as *six
pairs*. Of each pair one cetasika is a quality pertaining to the
accompanying cetasikas and one a quality pertaining to citta. The first
pair is:

- tranquillity of body, kāya-passaddhi
- tranquillity of mind, citta-passaddhi

The Pāli term kāya means body, but it can also stand for the “mental
body” which are the cetasikas. According to the *Dhammasangaṇi* (par 40,
41) tranquillity of body is the calming, the tranquillizing of the
cetasikas and tranquillity of citta is the calming, the tranquillizing
of citta. Thus, tranquillity of body allays agitation of the
accompanying cetasikas and conditions the quiet, smooth and even way of
their functioning[(176)](#FOOT176); tranquillity of citta allays
agitation of the citta it accompanies.

The *Atthasālinī* (Book I, Part IV, Chapter I, 130) explains about
tranquillity of body and tranquillity of mind:

> …These two states taken together have the characteristic of pacifying
> the suffering of both mental factors and of consciousness; the
> function of crushing the suffering of both; the manifestation of an
> unwavering and cool state of both; and have mental factors and
> consciousness as proximate cause. They are the opponents of the
> corruptions, such as distraction (uddhacca), which cause the
> disturbance of mental factors and of consciousness.

The *Visuddhimagga* (XIV, 144) gives a similar definition. Tranquillity
is the opponent of restlessness or distraction, uddhacca, which prevents
the arising of kusala citta. When we, for example, strive after
something with attachment, there is also restlessness and there cannot
be calm. Not only when we want to have something for ourselves, but also
when we merely like something such as a particular colour there is
restlessness, and then there is no calm. We keep on being infatuated
with pleasant sense objects and we may not notice attachment which is
subtle. At such moments there is restlessness.

When the citta is kusala citta there is calm of citta and cetasikas,
there is no restlessness nor agitation at that moment. There is a “cool
state of mind”, no infatuation with the object which is experienced, no
restlessness. However, it is not easy to recognize the characteristic of
calm. The different types of citta succeed one another very rapidly and
shortly after the kusala cittas have fallen away akusala cittas tend to
arise. Right understanding has to be keen in order to know the
characteristic of calm. If there is no right understanding we may take
for calm what is not calm but another reality. For example, when we are
alone, in a quiet place, we may think that there is calm while there is
actually attachment to silence.

There are likely to be misunderstandings about calm. What we call calm
or tranquillity in conventional language is not the same as the
realities of tranquillity of cetasikas and tranquillity of citta.
Someone may think that he is calm when he is free from worry, but this
calm may not be kusala at all. There may be citta rooted in attachment
which thinks of something else in order not to worry. At such a moment
he cannot at the same time think of the object of his worry since citta
can experience only one object at a time. Or people may do breathing
exercises in order to become relaxed. Tranquillity of cetasikas and
tranquillity of citta which are sobhana cetasikas are not the same as a
feeling of relaxation which is connected with attachment. We should know
the characteristic of true calm which is wholesome.

There are many degrees of calm. When we are generous or observe the
moral precepts there is calm of cetasikas and of citta. At such moments
there is no restlessness, agitation or worry. The feeling which
accompanies the kusala citta is also calm. We may notice the difference
between pleasant feeling which accompanies attachment and pleasant
feeling which accompanies generosity; these feelings have different
qualities. Those who have accumulated inclinations for higher degrees of
calm can develop it if there is right understanding which knows
precisely the characteristic of calm. Those who are able to cultivate
samatha and attain jhāna experience a high degree of calm since there
are at the moments of jhāna no sense impressions and, thus, no
enslavement to them. However, even the calm of the highest stage of
jhāna cannot eradicate defilements. They will arise again after the
jhānacittas have fallen away.

People in the Buddha’s time and also people before his time developed
calm, even to the degree of jhāna, if they had accumulated the skill and
the inclination to do so. The development of calm is not specifically
Buddhist. The fact that the Buddha and his disciples developed calm to
the stage of jhāna does not mean that everybody has to develop jhāna in
order to be able to also develop vipassanā. The Buddha explained that
also jhānacitta could be object of insight, in order to help those who
were able to attain jhāna not to cling to it, but to understand it as it
is: impermanent and not self. We should remember this whenever we read
in the scriptures about the attainment of jhāna. If someone has
accumulated the capability to reach higher degrees of calm even to the
stage of jhāna, they will arise because of conditions. Anything which
arises can be object of awareness, and thus also jhāna. The attainment
of jhāna is not an aim in itself, neither is it a necessary requirement
for the attainment of enlightenment.

We can have moments of calm in our daily life when we study the
teachings and reflect on them in a wholesome way. The object of
reflection is then actually one of the forty meditation subjects of
samatha, that is, recollection of the Dhamma. This meditation subject
comprises recollection on the teachings as well as recollection on
nibbāna and the eight types of lokuttara cittas which experience it, the
“nine supramundane dhammas”, included in the Dhamma which is the second
of the Triple Gem. There can also be moments of calm when we develop
loving kindness or one of the other meditation subjects which suit our
inclinations. However, we should remember that it is extremely difficult
to attain jhāna or even “access-concentration”[(177)](#FOOT177). We read
in the *Visuddhimagga* (XII, 8) that only very few people, “one in a
hundred or a thousand” are able to do so. If someone only wants to
develop calm without right understanding of its characteristic, he is
likely to cling to calm without knowing it. If calm arises it does so
because of conditions and there is no self who can exert power over it.

Tranquillity of cetasikas and of citta accompany each kusala citta and,
thus, they arise also when insight is being developed. When there is
right understanding of a nāma or a rūpa which appears there is calm at
that moment. When, for example, visible object is known as only a rūpa
appearing through the eyesense, not a person, there is calm. At that
moment there cannot be disturbance caused by desire nor can there be
annoyance. Even when someone treats us badly there can be right
understanding of the objects appearing through the six doors, and then
we are not perturbed nor afraid.

Calm is one of the factors of enlightenment. We read in the *Book of
Analysis* (Chapter 10, Analysis of the Enlightenment Factors, par 469):

> …That which is calmness of body (cetasikas), that calmness
> enlightenment factor is for full knowledge, for enlightenment, for
> full emancipation also. That which is calmness of consciousness, that
> calmness-enlightenment factor is for full knowledge, for
> enlightenment, for full emancipation also.

As right understanding develops the enlightenment factor of calm
develops as well. We do not have to aim for calm. When the enlightenment
factor of calm accompanies at the moment of enlightenment lokuttara
citta, it is also lokuttara. As defilements are eradicated at the
subsequent stages of enlightenment there will be more peace of mind,
less restlessness. The arahat who has eradicated all defilements has
reached true calm which cannot be disturbed again by defilements. We
read in the *Dhammapada* (verse 96) about the arahat:

 ``` 
 Calm is his mind, 
 calm is his speech, 
 calm is his action, 
 who, rightly knowing, is wholly freed, 
 perfectly peaceful, and equiposed. 

 ``` 


The next pair of sobhana cetasikas is:

- lightness of cetasikas, kāya-lahutā
- lightness of citta, citta-lahutā

According to the *Dhammasangaṇi* (par 42, 43) this pair of cetasikas
consists in the absence of sluggishness and inertia, they have
“alertness in varying”. The meaning of this will be clearer when we read
what the “Mūla-Tīkā”[(178)](#FOOT178) states about lightness of citta:
“the capacity of the mind to turn very quickly to a wholesome object or
to the contemplation of impermanence, etc.”

The *Atthasālinī* (I, Book I, Part IV, Chapter I, 30) explains:

> Kāya-lightness is buoyancy of mental factors; citta-lightness is
> buoyancy of consciousness. They have the characteristic of suppressing
> the heaviness of the one and the other; the function of crushing
> heaviness in both; the manifestation of opposition to sluggishness in
> both, and have mental factors and consciousness as proximate cause.
> They are the opponents of the corruptions, such as sloth and torpor,
> which cause heaviness and rigidity in mental factors and
> consciousness.

The *Visuddhimagga* (XIV, 145) gives a similar definition. Lightness is
the opponent of sloth and torpor (thīna and middha), which cause
heaviness and sluggishness with regard to kusala. When there is akusala
citta, there is mental heaviness and we are unable to perform any kind
of kusala. Kusala citta needs confidence (saddhā), it needs mindfulness
or non-forgetfulness and it also needs mental lightness which suppresses
heaviness and rigidity. When there is lightness of cetasikas and of
citta they react with alertness so that the opportunity for kusala is
not wasted.

There are many moments of unawareness. There are seeing, visible object
or hardness time and again, but we may be dull and tired without any
interest in awareness. However, when mindfulness arises there are also
lightness of cetasikas and of citta which perform their functions: all
tiredness is gone and there is alertness. Lightness is needed for the
development of right understanding. When understanding of what appears
through one of the six doors is being developed, there is also lightness
which “crushes” sluggishness. If this moment is not wasted realities can
eventually be seen as impermanent and not self.

Another pair of the sobhana cetasikas is:

- pliancy of cetasikas, kāya-mudutā
- pliancy of citta, citta-mudutā

According to the *Dhammasangaṇi* (par 44, 45) this pair of cetasikas
consist in suavity, smoothness and absence of rigidity.

The *Atthasālinī* ( I, Book I, Part IV, Chapter I, 130) explains:

> They have the characteristic of suppressing the rigidity of mental
> factors and of consciousness; the function of crushing the same in
> both; the manifestation or effect of setting up no resistance; and
> have mental factors and consciousness as proximate cause. They are the
> opponents of the corruptions, such as opinionatedness (diṭṭhi) and
> conceit which cause mental rigidity.

The *Visuddhimagga* (XIV, 146) gives a similar definition.

Pliancy of cetasikas and of citta are the opponents of wrong view and
conceit. Wrong view causes rigidity and inflexibility. When someone, for
example, is attached to wrong practice of the eightfold Path it shows
that there is mental rigidity. He may stick to his old habits and way of
thinking and then it is very difficult to eradicate wrong view. Someone
may, for example, think that he should be at leisure or in a quiet place
before he can develop right understanding. Even when we know in theory
that this is not right it may happen that we still presume that there
cannot be awareness when we are tired or in a hurry. Such presumptions
are a hindrance to develop understanding of whatever reality appears in
our daily life. When we have listened to the Dhamma and we consider it
there can be a beginning of the development of insight. We should not
expect understanding to be perfect at once, but at least we can begin to
develop it now.

As we have read in the definition, pliancy of cetasikas and of citta are
the opponents also of conceit. When there is conceit there is mental
rigidity. We are inclined to compare ourselves time and again with
others in a conceited way as regards health, appearance, gain, honour or
intelligence. Conceit is extremely hard to eradicate, only the arahat
has eradicated it completely.

Pliancy of cetasikas and of citta assist the kusala citta so that there
is no mental rigidity or intolerance, but open-mindedness to what is
right. The *Atthasālinī* (I, Book I Part IV, Chapter II, 151) explains
further on about mental pliancy that it is suavity, non-roughness and
non-rigidity. When there is loving kindness there is suavity and
gentleness. Mental pliancy or malleability is indispensable for each
wholesome action. Pliancy is also necessary in order to listen to the
Dhamma, to receive it and to be mindful of the reality which appears in
order to know it as it is.

We read in the *Gradual Sayings* (IV, Book of the Eights, Chapter II,
par 2, Sīha the general) that Sīha visited the Buddha and questioned him
on different points. The Buddha knew that Sīha had accumulated right
understanding and that it was the right time for him to receive the
Dhamma. He did not explain to Sīha immediately the four Noble Truths,
but he gave him a gradual discourse. We read:

> Then the Exalted One preached a graduated discourse to Sīha, the
> general, that is to say: on almsgiving, the precepts and on heaven. He
> set forth the peril, the folly and the depravity of lusts and the
> blessedness of renunciation.
>
> And when the Exalted One knew that the heart of Sīha, the general, was
> clear, malleable, free from hindrance, uplifted and lucid, then he
> revealed that teaching of Dhamma which Buddhas alone have won, that is
> to say: Dukkha, its coming to be, its ending and the Way. Just as a
> clean cloth, free of all stain, will take dye perfectly; even so in
> Sīha, the general, seated there, there arose the spotless, stainless
> vision of Dhamma; that whatsoever be conditioned by coming to be, all
> that is subject to ending.

It was the right time for Sīha to receive the Dhamma. He saw things as
they are and attained enlightenment.

Another pair of sobhana cetasikas is:

- wieldiness of cetasikas, kāya-kammaññatā
- wieldiness of citta, citta-kammaññatā

Kammaññatā can be translated as wieldiness or
workableness[(179)](#FOOT179). The *Atthasālinī* (I, Book I, Part IV,
Chapter I, 131) explains that they suppress unwieldiness in cetasikas
and citta, and that they should be regarded as “bringing faith in
objects of faith, and patient application in works of advantage, and are
like purity of gold.”[(180)](#FOOT180)

When there is wieldiness, citta and cetasikas are like gold which has
been made workable. The “Mūla-Tīkā”[(181)](#FOOT181) expresses this as
follows:

> Workableness signifies that specific or suitable degree of pliancy or
> softness which makes the gold, that is, the mind, workable. While the
> mind is in the flames of passion it is too soft to be workable, as
> molten gold is. If, on the contrary, the mind is too rigid then it is
> comparable to untempered gold.

Wieldiness is the opponent of the “hindrances”, such as sensuous desire
(kāmacchanda) and anger or hate (vyāpāda), which cause mental
unwieldiness. We read in the *Kindred Sayings* (V, Mahā-vagga, Book II,
Chapter IV, par 3, Corruptions) about five corruptions of gold whereby
gold is impure, brittle, not pliant or workable. It is the presence of
other metals, of iron, copper, tin, lead and silver which makes it
unwieldy. Even so the five hindrances make the mind unwieldy. We read:

> …Likewise, monks, there are those five defilements of the mind, owing
> to which the mind is not pliant, not workable, impure, brittle and is
> not perfectly composed for the extinction of the passions. Which are
> those five? Sensual desire, ill will, sloth and torpor, agitation and
> worry, doubt—these are the defilements of the mind owing to which the
> mind is not pliant, not workable, impure, brittle and is not perfectly
> composed for the extinction of passions.

As we have seen, according to the *Atthasālinī*, wieldiness brings faith
(saddhā) in objects of faith and patient application in kusala.
Wieldiness is necessary for each kind of kusala, for generosity (dāna),
for morality (sīla), for the development of calm and for the development
of insight. Wieldiness makes the mind workable so that one can apply
oneself to kusala with confidence and with patience. When someone, for
example, wants to develop calm with loving kindness as meditation
subject , he cannot be successful when there is no mental wieldiness.
When there is ill-will there is rigidity instead of wieldiness. In order
to have loving kindness for all beings, not only for dear friends, but
also for people one does not know or even for one’s enemies, there has
to be wieldiness. Without wieldiness one cannot succeed in becoming calm
with any meditation subject.

Wieldiness of cetasikas and of citta also perform their functions in the
development of insight; they are conditions for patience in the
development of right understanding of nāma and rūpa. When there is right
understanding of a nāma or a rūpa as only a conditioned reality, not
self, there is wieldiness of mind. The development of insight leads to
the eradication of the hindrances. The person who has eradicated them
has no more unwieldiness but perfect wieldiness.

Another pair of sobhana cetasikas is:

- proficiency of cetasikas, kāya-pāguññatā
- proficiency of citta, citta-pāguññatā

According to the *Dhammasangaṇi* (par 48, 49) this pair of cetasikas
consists in fitness, competence and efficiency. Pāguññatā is fitness,
competence or efficiency in the performance of kusala.

The *Atthasālinī* (I, Book I, Part IV, Chapter I, 131) explains that
proficiency of cetasikas and of citta suppress mental illness and that
they are the opponents of the corruptions, such as diffidence, which
cause mental illness[(182)](#FOOT182).

When the citta is akusala citta, there is diffidence, lack of confidence
in kusala and then there is mental sickness. Mental proficiency assists
the kusala citta and then citta and cetasikas are healthy and skilful so
that they can perform their functions in the most efficient way.

There are many degrees of efficiency in kusala. When right understanding
is being developed, it conditions proficiency and skilfulness in all
kinds of kusala. The sotāpanna has eradicated wrong view, doubt and
stinginess, and he will never neglect the five moral precepts. His
generosity and his observance of morality is purer than the generosity
and morality of the non-ariyan, he has no clinging to a wrong idea of
“my kusala”. His confidence in the Buddha’s teachings has become
unshakable, it has become a “power”. He has, in comparison to the
non-ariyan, a higher degree of efficiency and competence with regard to
kusala. He can assist others in a competent and efficient way, and thus
we see that the development of right understanding also bears on one’s
relationship with others. We read in the *Gradual Sayings* (V, Book of
the Elevens, Chapter II, par 4, Subhūti) that the Buddha spoke to
Subhūti about the traditional marks of belief (saddhā) in a believer.
One of these “traditional marks” is the following:

> …Again, in all the undertakings of his fellows in the Brahma-life, be
> they matters weighty or trivial, he is shrewd and energetic,
> possessing ability to give proper consideration thereto, as to what is
> the fit thing to do and how to manage it. In so far as a monk is such,
> this also is a traditional mark…

There is a higher degree of proficiency as higher stages of
enlightenment are attained and defilements eradicated. At the stage of
arahatship proficiency has reached perfection.

The last pair of he six pairs of sobhana cetasikas is:

- uprightness of cetasika, kāya-ujukatā
- uprightness of citta, citta-ujukatā

According to the *Dhammasangaṇi* (par 50, 51) this pair of cetasikas
consists in straightness and rectitude, being without deflection, twist
or crookedness.

The *Atthasālinī* (I, Book I, Part IV, Chapter I, 131) explains that
uprightness of cetasikas and of citta crush crookedness and that they
are the opponents of the corruptions, such as deception and craftiness,
which cause crookedness in mental factors and
consciousness[(183)](#FOOT183).

Uprightness is the opponent of deception and craftiness. There may be
moments that one’s behaviour is insincere. We read in the
*Visuddhimagga* (I, 60-84) about the behaviour of the monk who tries to
obtain the requisites by hypocrisy, by hinting, flattery, indirect talk,
grimaces and gestures. He pretends to be better than he in reality is in
order to be admired. We read (I, 70):

> Here someone of evil wishes, a prey to wishes, eager to be admired,
> (thinking) “Thus people will admire me”, composes his way of walking,
> composes his way of lying down; he walks studiedly, stands studiedly,
> sits studiedly, lies down studiedly; he walks as though concentrated,
> stands, sits, lies down as though concentrated; and he is one who
> meditates in public…

We all want to be admired and therefore we may pretend to be better than
we really are. Even when it seems that we are generous there tend to be
selfish motives for our actions. We may expect something in return, we
want to be praised, to be popular. Speech which seems pleasing may be
directed towards selfish gain. Uprightness crushes such insincerity. It
assists each kusala citta. There are many degrees of uprightness. To the
extent that right understanding develops also uprightness develops. The
ariyan is called the person who is on the straight, true and proper way
(ujupatipanno, Vis. VII, 90-92). He is on the middle Path, avoiding
extremes; he is on the Path which leads to the eradication of
defilements. One is on the middle Path when there is the development of
understanding of whatever reality appears, even if it is akusala. We can
develop right understanding in daily life, no matter whether we laugh or
cry, no matter whether we are angry or generous. Thus we will learn the
truth, we will learn that each reality which arises is conditioned and
that it is non-self. In the above quoted explanation of insincerity in
the *Visuddhimagga* we read about the monk who walks, stands, sits and
lies down as though concentrated. Someone may believe that he is doing
these things with concentration which is kusala, although this is not
so. When there is mindfulness of realities we can find out whether the
citta which presents itself is kusala citta or akusala citta. We will
come to know ourselves and, thus, we will become more sincere. The
person who is on the middle Way is honest with himself and he does not
pretend that he is without defilements. Defilements can only be
eradicated if they are known as they are. Straightness of cetasikas and
of citta accompany the citta which develops understanding and they
assist the citta in this task.

Summarizing the six pairs of sobhana cetasikas, they are:

1. calm of cetasikas, kāya-passaddhi

 calm of citta, citta-passaddhi

2. lightness of cetasikas, kāya-lahutā

 lightness of citta, citta-lahutā

3. pliancy of cetasikas, kāya-mudutā

 pliancy of citta, citta-mudutā

4. wieldiness of cetasikas, kāya-kammaññatā

 wieldiness of citta, citta-kammaññatā

5. proficiency of cetasikas, kāya-pāguññatā

 proficiency of citta, citta-pāguññatā

6. uprightness of cetasikas, kāya-ujukatā

 uprightness of citta, citta-ujukatā

These six pairs accompany all sobhana cittas. They are necessary for
each kind of kusala, be it generosity (dāna), morality (sīla), the
development of calm (samatha) or insight (vipassanā). They assist the
kusala citta and its accompanying cetasikas, so that wholesomeness can
be performed in an efficient way. They are counteractive to the
hindrances of sensuous desire, ill-will, sloth and torpor, restlessness
and regret, and doubt. When the six pairs are present the hindrances do
not arise; citta and cetasikas are healthy and skilful in performing
their functions. Right understanding is the factor which conditions most
of all the development of all the wholesome qualities represented by the
six pairs. In the arahat they have reached perfection.

As we have seen, there are at least *nineteen sobhana cetasikas* which
accompany each sobhana citta[(184)](#FOOT184). All these cetasikas
accompany the sobhana cittas of the sense-sphere (kāmāvacara sobhana
cittas), the sobhana cittas which are rūpa-jhānacittas (of fine-material
jhāna) and arūpa-jhānacittas (of immaterial jhāna), and the sobhana
cittas which are lokuttara cittas. This does not mean that all these
sobhana cittas are accompanied by only nineteen sobhana cetasikas. In
addition to the nineteen sobhana cetasikas which accompany each sobhana
citta, there are six more, and I shall deal with these in the following
chapters.
