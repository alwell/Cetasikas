Introduction
------------

When we perform dāna, observe sīla, apply ourselves to the development
of calm or the development of insight there is kusala citta. Kusala
citta is accompanied by sobhana (beautiful) cetasikas and these assist
the citta in performing its task. At the moment of kusala citta there is
no attachment, aversion or ignorance, one is temporarily free from
defilements. However, after the kusala cittas have fallen away there are
bound to be akusala cittas. There are many more akusala cittas in our
life than kusala cittas.

Kusala citta does not often arise since we have accumulated so many
defilements. Each kusala citta is accompanied by non-attachment
(alobha), but this quality seems to be against our nature. We are
absorbed in and infatuated with the objects we experience through the
six doors. We want pleasant objects for ourselves and it is our nature
to think of ourselves in the first place. Akusala is deeply rooted and
so long as latent tendencies have not been eradicated akusala citta is
bound to arise time and again. Even if we try not to be stingy, jealous
or proud, these defilements still arise. There is no self who has
authority over the cittas which arise, cittas are not self. When we
experience a beautiful object attachment tends to arise and when we
experience an unpleasant object aversion tends to arise.

We read in the *Gradual Sayings* (Book of the Ones, Chapter II, par1-5):

> Monks, I know not of any other single thing of such power to cause the
> arising of sensual lust, if not already arisen, or, if arisen, to
> cause its more-becoming and increase, as the feature of beauty (in
> things).
>
> In him who pays not wise attention to the feature of beauty, sensual
> lust, if not already arisen, arises; or, if already arisen, is liable
> to more becoming and increase.
>
> Monks, I know not of any other single thing of such power to cause the
> arising of malevolence, if not already arisen, or, if arisen, to cause
> its more-becoming and increase, as the repulsive feature (of things).
>
> In him who pays not wise attention to the repulsive feature,
> malevolence, if not already arisen, arises; or, if arisen, it is
> liable to more-becoming and increase.

It may seem to us that a desirable object is the fundamental cause of
attachment and an unpleasant object the fundamental cause of
aversion[(149)](#FOOT149). However, the real cause of akusala is not in
the object which is experienced. Whether akusala citta or kusala citta
arises, depends on one’s accumulations. There can be wise attention or
unwise attention to the object, depending on conditions. When there is
wise attention to the object we see the value of kusala and we have
confidence in kusala. However, more often akusala citta arises and then
there is unwise attention to the object. It is possible to change our
habits and develop kusala. Gradually our accumulations can be changed
through the study of the Dhamma and the development of right
understanding.

Through the study of the Dhamma we may begin to realize that conditioned
realities do not last, that they are impermanent. We may remember more
often that it is useless to cling to our possessions since our life is
short and we cannot take our possessions with us when we die. The Buddha
explained that it is difficult to be reborn in the human plane where
there is an opportunity to hear the Dhamma and to develop right
understanding of realities. We should therefore not, like fools, waste
our life with akusala.

We read in the *Kindred Sayings* (I, Sagāthā-vagga, The Devas, Chapter
IV, par 6, Faith):


                                      
 ```                       
 …It is a fool's part heedless to waste his life:---                      
 Such are the folk who will not understand.                               
 He who is wise does foster earnestness                                   
 As he were watching over his chiefest wealth.                            
 Give not yourselves to wastage in your lives,                            
 Nor be familiar with delights of sense.                                  
 He who does strenuously meditate,
 His shall it be to win the bliss supreme.  
                              
 ```                                  


The person who with courage and perseverance develops right
understanding will win “the bliss supreme”, he will eventually attain
arahatship. The Buddha pointed out the dangers and disadvantages of
akusala, its ill effects both in this life and in the lives to come. It
is right understanding which sees the disadvantage of akusala and the
benefit of kusala. We can find out from our own experience that
happiness connected with attachment makes us restless, since attachment
can never be satisfied, and that generosity and consideration for others
can condition peace of mind. We may be inclined to anger, but when we
see the value of kusala we can develop loving kindness. We may be
inclined to stinginess, but when we see the value of generosity there
are conditions for generosity instead of stinginess. The kusala citta
which arises falls away immediately but kusala is accumulated and thus
there is a condition for the arising of kusala citta again later on.
Mindfulness of nāma and rūpa is difficult so long as sati has not been
accumulated. If we see that right understanding cannot grow without
mindfulness of the reality appearing at the present moment, there are
conditions for the arising of mindfulness more often. There is no other
moment but the present moment in which we can develop right
understanding. The Buddha used the simile of the well-trained horse, the
“thorough-bred”, in order to point out that right understanding should
be developed. A horse does not become well-trained in one day, he has to
practise certain things over and over again. In the same way we should
not expect to attain enlightenment without developing right
understanding.

We read in the *Gradual Sayings* (Book of the Sixes, Chapter I, par5,
The thorough-bred):

> Monks, a rajah’s goodly thorough-bred endowed with six points is fit
> for a rajah, is a rajah’s asset, is reckoned a rajah’s portion. What
> six?
>
> Herein, monks, the goodly thorough-bred endures forms, sounds, smells,
> tastes, touches and has beauty…Even so, monks, a monk with six
> qualities is worthy of offerings…the world’s peerless field for merit.
> What six?
>
> Herein, monks, a monk endures forms, sounds, smells, tastes, touches
> and things of the mind.
>
> Verily, monks, a monk with these six qualities is worthy of offerings…

One will learn to “endure” the objects which present themselves through
the six doors by the development of right understanding of realities. At
the moment of mindfulness of the reality which appears paññā can
investigate it so that it will be seen as it is: only a nāma or a rūpa,
not self. Eventually one will no longer be absorbed in and infatuated
with the objects which are experienced.

In order to be able to apply oneself to the development of kusala and in
particular to the development of right understanding, there have to be
the right conditions for it. The *Atthasālinī* (Part II, Chapter I, 75)
mentions these right conditions: residence in a suitable place,
dependence on good associates, hearing the “good Dhamma”, merit
performed in former existences. It is helpful to live in a country or
place where one can hear the Dhamma and learn to develop the Path which
leads to the eradication of defilements. In order to learn how to be
mindful of nāma and rūpa one should associate with the good friend in
Dhamma (kalyāṇa-mitta) who can explain the Dhamma in the right way.

What are the qualities the good friend in Dhamma should have? We read in
the *Middle Length Sayings* (III, no. 110, Lesser Discourse at the time
of a Full Moon) that the Buddha, while he was staying near Sāvatthī, in
the palace of Migāra’s mother, in the Eastern Monastery, spoke to the
monks about the bad man (asappurisa) and the good man (sappurisa). We
read about the good friends a good man consorts with: …And how, monks,
does a good man consort with good men? As to this, monks, those recluses
and brahmans who have faith (saddhā), shame, fear of blame, who have
heard much, are of stirred up energy, whose mindfulness is aroused, who
have wisdom—these are the friends and companions of that good man. It is
thus, monks, that a good man consorts with good men…

The ariyan is endowed with the qualities of the good men, mentioned in
the sutta. He has an unshakable confidence in the Buddha, the Dhamma and
the Sangha, and in wholesomeness. How can we find out who is an ariyan?
So long as we have not attained enlightenment ourselves we cannot know
who is an ariyan. It depends on conditions whether or not someone will
meet an ariyan. However, we can find out whether or not our friend in
the Dhamma helps us to develop right understanding.

The Buddha taught that all realities are anattā, non-self, but it is
extremely hard to become more detached from the self in the situations
of daily life. We think of ourselves most of the time, we want to get
pleasant things for ourselves. When we associate with the good friend in
the Dhamma we can learn to develop right understanding and then there
will eventually be less clinging to the concept of self. The person who
has developed right understanding and encourages others through his
example to be less selfish and more considerate for others is a true
friend in the Dhamma. He does not pay mere lip-service to the Dhamma,
but he practises the Dhamma in his daily life.

“Hearing the good Dhamma” is also a necessary factor for the development
of kusala. We should not listen passively; when we truly listen, we
consider what we hear and apply it; otherwise the listening is not
fruitful.

Another factor which conditions the development of kusala is
“meritorious deeds done in the past”. If someone has applied himself to
dāna, sīla and bhāvanā in the past he has conditions for confidence in
kusala today.

The consideration of the conditions for kusala can remind us of the fact
that nothing arises without the appropriate conditions. Kusala citta
does not belong to a self; there is no self who can direct the arising
of kusala citta.

The *Atthasālinī* (I, Part II, Chapter I, 62) states about kusala:

> By kusala is meant (moral) “good” in the sense of destroying or
> disturbing contemptible states; or in the sense of wholesomeness,
> faultlessness, and accomplishment by skill…

The *Atthasālinī* explains that the word “kusala” can be used in the
sense of healthy, not being sick in body. When the word kusala is used
for mental phenomena, “it should be understood in the sense of ’health’,
i.e., absence of sickness, illness or disease through the ’corruptions’.
Moreover, from the absence of the faultiness, hate, and torments of the
’corruptions’, kusala has the sense of faultlessness.”

The *Atthasālinī*, in the same section (63), defines kusala as follows:

> its characteristic is that it has faultless, happy results,
>
> its function is the destruction of immoralities,
>
> its manifestation is purity,
>
> its proximate cause is wise attention.

The *Atthasālinī* gives a second method of defining kusala:

> its characteristic is faultlessness by being opposed to fault,
>
> its function is purity,
>
> its manifestation is desirable results,
>
> its proximate cause is wise attention.

The *characteristic* of kusala, according to the first definition, is
that it has pleasant results, whereas, according to the second
definition, pleasant results are the *manifestation* of kusala.
Classifications are not rigid and by means of different methods of
classification different aspects are shown. Pleasant results can be
experienced in daily life, they are a manifestation of the fact that
good deeds have been performed. Whenever we see, hear, smell, taste or
touch a pleasant object there is kusala vipākacitta, the result of a
good deed. The moments of vipākacitta fall away immediately, they are
only conditioned elements which do not last. When this truth has not
been realized there is bound to be clinging to pleasant objects and
sadness when these objects are gone.

The characteristic of kusala, according to the second definition, is
faultlessness by being opposed to fault. At the moment of kusala citta
there is no opportunity for akusala citta. When there is an opportunity
for kusala it should not be neglected. There are opportunities for
kusala right at hand, such as a kind word, a thought of appreciation of
other people’s good qualities, or a moment of mindfulness of realities
such as hardness, softness, sound or hearing.

We should find out whether there is at this moment, on account of what
is seen, kusala citta or akusala citta. We are usually absorbed in the
details of the things around us, but sometimes there can be confidence
in the value of awareness of the reality which appears now. Even if we
are only beginners and there is not yet clear understanding of nāma and
rūpa, there can be confidence in awareness of the present reality and
then there are kusala cittas.

The function of kusala, according to the first definition, is the
destruction of akusala. Akusala cannot be eradicated unless right
understanding of realities has been developed, but this does not mean
that dāna or sīla should be neglected. Through right understanding the
wrong view of self can be eliminated, but, if there is no development of
generosity and we keep on clinging to our possessions, how could there
ever be detachment from the self? It is beneficial to develop all kinds
of kusala for which we have accumulations, but when it is developed
together with right understanding of realities akusala can eventually be
eradicated.

Purity is the manifestation of kusala according to the first definition,
whereas in the second definition purity is the function of kusala. When
the citta is akusala, it is impure, unclean. When we are attached to an
object we experience, we are enslaved and at such a moment the citta is
not pure. Whereas when kusala citta arises, there is no enslavement, no
selfishness; the citta is pure, free from defilements. If we know the
difference between akusala citta and kusala citta we can understand that
purity is a quality of kusala citta.

According to both definitions, the proximate cause of kusala is wise
attention. When akusala citta arises there is unwise attention to the
object and when kusala citta arises there is wise attention to the
object. When there is wise attention, there is no infatuation with the
object, there is no aversion, no ignorance. Seeing realities as they are
conditions wise attention. The arahat has the highest degree of wise
attention: for him defilements do not arise on account of any object he
experiences, no matter it is pleasant or unpleasant.

Kusala citta does not arise alone, it is accompanied by cetasikas: by
the *universals* (sabbacitta sādhāranā), the cetasikas which accompany
each citta, by *particulars* (pakiṇṇakā), cetasikas which accompany
cittas of the four classes (jātis) of kusala, akusala, vipāka and
kiriya[(150)](#FOOT150) , but which do not accompany every citta, and by
*sobhana cetasikas*, beautiful cetasikas. Kusala citta cannot be
accompanied by akusala cetasikas. One may wonder why the term “sobhana”
and not the term “kusala” is used for cetasikas which accompany kusala
citta. The reason is that sobhana cetasikas do not only accompany kusala
cittas, but also cittas of the jātis which are vipāka and
kiriya[(151)](#FOOT151). All the cittas which are accompanied by sobhana
cetasikas are called sobhana cittas.

There are twentyfour sobhana cittas of the sense-sphere, kāma-sobhana
cittas. They are:

-   8 mahā-kusala cittas[(152)](#FOOT152)
-   8 mahā-vipākacittas
-   8 mahā-kiriyacittas[(153)](#FOOT153)

Cittas of the sense-sphere can be sobhana cittas, cittas accompanied by
sobhana cetasikas, or asobhana cittas, cittas which are not accompanied
by sobhana cetasikas. Cittas of the planes of consciousness other than
the sensuous plane are always sobhana cittas. Those who have developed
calm to the stage of absorption, jhāna, have jhāna-cittas and these are
sobhana cittas. There are rūpa-jhānacittas or rūpāvacara cittas and
arūpa-jhānacittas or arūpāvacara cittas. Rūpa-jhāna can be translated as
“fine-material” jhāna and arūpa-jhāna can be translated as “immaterial”
jhāna. Arūpa-jhāna is more refined than rūpa-jhāna since the meditation
subjects of arūpa-jhāna are not dependant on materiality.

The sobhana cittas which are rūpāvacara cittas, pertaining to five
stages of rūpa-jhāna, are the following:

-   5 rūpāvacara kusala cittas
-   5 rūpāvacara vipākacittas
-   5 rūpāvacara kiriyacittas (of the arahat)

The sobhana cittas which are arūpāvacara cittas, pertaining to four
stages of arūpa-jhāna, are the following:

-   4 arūpāvacara kusala cittas
-   4 arūpāvacara vipākacittas
-   4 arūpāvacara kiriyacittas

Apart from the sobhana cittas which are jhānacittas, there are sobhana
cittas which are lokuttara cittas, supramundane cittas experiencing
nibbāna. There are *eight lokuttara cittas*, but when one takes into
account the lokuttara cittas which are accompanied by jhāna-factors of
the different stages of jhāna, there are *forty lokuttara
cittas*[(154)](#FOOT154).

When cittas are counted as *eightynine* (not including lokuttara cittas
accompanied by jhāna-factors of the different stages of jhāna), there
are *fiftynine sobhana cittas*, and when cittas are counted as *hundred
and twentyone* (including forty lokuttara cittas accompanied by
jhāna-factors), there are *ninetyone* *sobhana cittas*.

Sobhana cittas are accompanied by the universals, by particulars and by
sobhana cetasikas. There are *twentyfive sobhana cetasikas in all* which
can accompany sobhana cittas. Not all twentyfive sobhana cetasikas
accompany every sobhana citta, but *at least nineteen sobhana cetasikas*
have to accompany each sobhana citta.

Among the twentyfive sobhana cetasikas *three are sobhana hetus*
(roots). These are:

-   non-attachment, alobha
-   non-aversion, adosa
-   wisdom, amoha or paññā

Non-attachment and non-aversion have to accompany every sobhana citta,
and wisdom or understanding may or may not accompany sobhana citta.

Every sobhana cetasika has its own specific characteristic, function,
manifestation and proximate cause (immediate occasion). When we perform
dāna, observe sīla, apply ourselves to the development of calm, samatha,
or insight, vipassanā, sobhana cetasikas assist the kusala citta in
carrying out its task of wholesomeness.

The sobhana vipākacittas are also accompanied by at least nineteen
sobhana cetasikas. Vipākacittas do not perform deeds, they are results.
Sobhana vipākacittas are results of deeds which are performed by kusala
cittas accompanied by sobhana cetasikas. The rebirth-consciousness, for
example, can be the result of a deed performed by kusala citta
accompanied by sobhana hetus and other sobhana cetasikas. In that case
it is sahetuka vipākacitta (with hetus).

The arahat does not perform kusala kamma, he is free from the cycle of
birth and death. Thus, instead of kusala cittas he has kiriyacittas
which are accompanied by sobhana hetus and other sobhana cetasikas.
Sobhana kiriyacittas are accompanied by at least nineteen sobhana
cetasikas.
