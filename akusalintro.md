Introduction to Akusala Cittas
==============================

Akusala citta and akusala cetasika are akusala dhammas, dhammas which
are unskilful, unprofitable, unclean, impure. Do we realize when there
is akusala citta? Whenever the citta is not intent on wholesomeness, we
act, speak or think with akusala citta. We may not have unkind thoughts
or thoughts of coarse desire, but the cittas which think can still be
akusala cittas; they are akusala cittas whenever we do not think
wholesome thoughts. We think time and again of people, of things which
have happened or will happen, and we should find out for ourselves when
thinking is kusala and when akusala. When we are “daydreaming”, do we
think wholesome thoughts? If that is not so, then the cittas are akusala
cittas.

By akusala one harms oneself, other people or both oneself and other
people. We may find it difficult to see that even when we do not harm or
hurt others, the citta can still be akusala. For example, when we like
nature, there is a degree of attachment and attachment is not kusala, it
is different from unselfishness. We may see the danger of akusala which
is coarse, but it is difficult to see the danger of akusala which is
more subtle. However, through the study of the Dhamma we can acquire
more understanding of akusala dhammas and then we may begin to see the
danger of all degrees of akusala.

When the citta is kusala, there is confidence in wholesomeness. Kusala
citta is pure and it is capable of producing a pleasant result. Whereas
akusala citta is impure and it leads to sorrow. At the moment of akusala
citta there is no confidence in wholesomeness, one does not see that
akusala citta is impure and harmful. For example, when we see a pleasant
sight, akusala cittas with attachment tend to arise. At such a moment
there is “unwise attention” to the object which is experienced; we are
enslaved to that object and do not see the danger of akusala. Thus we go
on accumulating more and more akusala.

If one has not listened to the Dhamma, one does not know exactly what is
kusala and what is akusala and thus there are many conditions for unwise
attention to the objects which are experienced through the five
sense-doors and through the mind-door. Foolish friends are also a
condition for akusala cittas. The person who is inclined to akusala will
associate with friends who have similar inclinations. Thus he
accumulates more and more vices and then it is very difficult to turn to
kusala and develop virtues.

Akusala citta is bound to arise more often than kusala citta because
there have been countless akusala cittas in the past and thus the
conditions for akusala have been accumulated. If there is no development
of right understanding akusala cannot be eradicated and we will continue
to accumulate more akusala.

The Buddha reminded people of the ill effects of akusala. Akusala kamma
is capable of producing an unpleasant result in the form of rebirth or
in the form of unpleasant experiences through the senses in the course
of our life. Through the doing of evil deeds one acquires a bad name and
one loses one’s friends. Moreover, the person who commits evil is not
calm when he faces death. We read in the *Gradual Sayings* (Book of the
Fours, the Fourth Fifty, Chapter XIX, par4, Fearless) that the brāhmin
Jāṇussoni said to the Buddha that he believed that everyone was afraid
of death. The Buddha thereupon spoke to Jāṇussoni about four kinds of
people who are afraid of death and four who are not. We read that the
Buddha said:

> …In this case, brāhmin, a certain one is not freed from passions, not
> freed from lusts, not freed from desire, affection, from thirst and
> fever, not freed from craving. Then a grievous sickness afflicts such
> an one. Thus afflicted by grievous sickness it occurs to him: Alas!
> The passions that I love will leave me, or I shall leave the passions
> that I love. Thereupon he grieves and wails, laments and beats the
> breast and falls into utter bewilderment. This one, brāhmin, being
> subject to death, is afraid, he falls a-trembling at the thought of
> death.
>
> Again, brāhmin, here a certain one who as regards body is not freed
> from lusts…is not freed from craving. Then a grievous sickness
> afflicts him. Thus afflicted it occurs to him: Alas! The body that I
> love will leave me, or I shall leave the body that I love. Thereupon
> he grieves…and falls into utter bewilderment. This one, brāhmin, being
> subject to death, is afraid, he falls a-trembling at the thought of
> death…

The same is said about the person who has omitted good deeds and
committed evil, and about the person who is full of doubts as to “true
Dhamma”. The opposite is true of the people who do not have these vices.
When a grievous sickness afflicts them they are not afraid of death.

We make ourselves unhappy through unwholesome deeds, speech and
thoughts, and then we have no peace of mind. Akusala is a mental disease
and this is more grave than bodily disease.

Right understanding of the danger and ill effects of akusala can
condition kusala citta. But shortly after the kusala cittas have fallen
away, akusala cittas tend to arise again and at such moments we have no
confidence in wholesomeness. We may, for example, speak harsh words to
someone else and when the moments of anger have fallen away, we cannot
understand that we behaved in such a bad way. We may wonder how we can
be such a different person at different moments. In reality there is no
self who is at one moment kusala and at another moment akusala. There
are different types of citta which arise because of their own
conditions. Sometimes kusala citta arises but more often akusala citta
arises. There is no self who can prevent the arising of akusala citta.

Because of ignorance we take the satisfaction in pleasant experiences
through the senses for true happiness. Do we consider the enjoyment of
pleasant things the goal of our life? We tend to forget that pleasant
things do not last, that our body declines and that we are susceptible
to sickness and death. There is ignorance with each akusala citta. At
such a moment we do not know the danger of the accumulation of akusala.

If we do not develop right understanding of realities we live with our
dreams and illusions. We want happiness for ourselves and we are
ignorant of what is kusala and what is akusala. Thus there is bound to
be decline in good qualities. We read in the *Gradual Sayings* (Book of
the Sixes, Chapter VIII, par10, Day and Night):

> …Monks, if a monk follow six things, come day come night, just a
> falling away in right things may be expected, not a growth. What six?
>
> Herein, monks, a monk desires much, is fretful, discontented with this
> and that requisite: robe, alms, lodging, medicaments—is without faith
> or virtue, is indolent, forgetful in mindfulness and lacks insight.
>
> Monks, if a monk follow these six, come day come night, just a falling
> away in right things may be expected, not a growth.
>
> (But the opposite is true for a monk who is not like that.)

This sutta can remind both monks and laypeople that if there is no
mindfulness of the reality appearing at this moment, no development of
insight, there will be decline in good qualities.

The Buddha, when he was still a Bodhisatta, considered the satisfaction
in life, the misery and also the escape therefrom. We read in the
*Gradual Sayings* (Book of the Threes, Chapter XI, par101, Before):

Before my enlightenment, monks, when I was yet but a Bodhisat, this
occurred to me: What, I wonder, is the satisfaction in the world, what
is the misery in the world, what is the escape therefrom?

Then, monks, this occurred to me: That condition in the world owing to
which pleasure arises, owing to which arises happiness,—that is the
satisfaction in the world. That impermanence, that suffering, that
changeability in the world,—that is the misery in the world. That
restraint, that riddance of desire and passion in the world,—that is the
escape therefrom…

The “escape” can be realized through the development of insight. Right
understanding of realities eventually leads to freedom from all akusala,
to the end of all sorrow.

The Abhidhamma teaches us in detail about all akusala dhammas. They are
not listed just to be read and memorized, they are *realities* of daily
life and they can be known as they are by being mindful of them. If we
consider akusala dhammas when they appear and begin to be mindful of
them, we will come to know also defilements which are more subtle. We
will learn that behaviour and speech we thought to be agreeable and
pleasant are often motivated by selfishness; this happens for example
when we want to endear ourselves to others in the expectation of some
gain or favour from them. Our actions and speech are more often
motivated by akusala cittas than by kusala cittas. Through the study of
the Abhidhamma we learn about many types of defilements which arise time
and again in our daily life. We learn about our tendencies and
inclinations to akusala which we did not know before.

Among the cetasikas which can accompany akusala cittas, there are three
which are unwholesome roots, akusala hetus[(83)](#FOOT83). These hetus
are the foundation of the akusala citta. They are:

-   attachment or greed, in Pāli: lobha
-   aversion or anger, in Pāli: dosa
-   ignorance, in Pāli: moha

Besides these roots there are other akusala cetasikas which can
accompany akusala citta, and each of these has its own characteristic
and function. There are *twelve types of akusala cittas* and they are
classified according to their roots. They are:

-   8 types of citta rooted in attachment, lobha-mūla-citta
-   2 types of citta rooted in aversion, dosa-mūla-citta
-   2 types of citta rooted in ignorance, moha-mūla-citta[(84)](#FOOT84)

The cittas rooted in attachment have ignorance, moha, and attachment,
lobha, as their roots; the cittas rooted in aversion have moha and
aversion, dosa, as their roots; the cittas rooted in moha have moha as
their only root. There is ignorance with each akusala citta.

Akusala cittas are accompanied by the “universals” and by the
“particulars”, but not all particulars accompany every akusala citta.
When the universals and the particulars accompany akusala citta they are
also akusala. There are *fourteen akusala cetasikas* which can accompany
only akusala citta, but not all akusala cetasikas accompany each akusala
citta. Some akusala cetasikas accompany only certain types of akusala
cittas. There are twelve types of akusala citta, but there are many more
varieties of them since they are, at one time or other, accompanied by
different cetasikas. Moreover, akusala cittas can have many different
degrees of akusala. Akusala citta may or may not have the intensity to
motivate an unwholesome deed, akusala kamma patha.

There are *four types of akusala cetasikas* which have to arise *with
every akusala citta*. These cetasikas are:

-   ignorance, moha
-   shamelessness, ahirika
-   recklessness, anottappa
-   restlessness, uddhacca

One of these, ignorance, is root, the other three are not roots. These
four types have to assist each akusala citta in performing its function.
So long as these types have not been eradicated akusala citta will
arise. Only the arahat has eradicated these four types. For him there
are no more conditions for the arising of akusala.
