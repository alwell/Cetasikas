### Six Sobhana Cetasikas which do not accompany each Sobhana Citta: {.subsection}

- abstinence from wrong speech, vacīduccarita virati
- abstinence from wrong action, kāyaduccarita virati
- abstinence from wrong livelihood, ājīvaduccarita virati
- compassion, karuṇā
- sympathetic joy, muditā
- understanding or wisdom, paññā

Thus, altogether there are *twenty-five sobhana cetasikas*, of which
nineteen arise with each sobhana citta and six do not arise with each
sobhana citta.

The three abstinences (the virati cetasikas) can accompany the following
cittas:

- eight mahā-kusala cittas which are of the sense-sphere (kamāvacara
 cittas)
- eight (or forty) lokuttara cittas which are always accompanied by
 all three abstinences
- Compassion (karuṇā) can accompany the following cittas:
- eight mahā-kusala cittas
- eight mahā-kiriyacittas
- twelve rūpāvacara cittas (the rūpāvacara kusala cittas, vipākacittas
 and kiriyacittas of the first, second, third and fourth stage of
 jhāna (of the fivefold system)

thus, compassion can accompany twenty-eight types of citta

Sympathetic joy (muditā) can accompany the following cittas:

- eight mahā-kusala cittas
- eight mahā-kiriyacittas
- twelve rūpāvacara cittas

thus, sympathetic joy can accompany twenty-eight types of citta in all.

Understanding (paññā) accompanies the following cittas:

- four mahā-kusala cittas (those which are called: ñāṇa-sampayutta,
 accompanied by understanding)
- four mahā-vipākacittas (ñāṇa-sampayutta)
- four mahā-kiriyacittas (ñāṇa-sampayutta)
- five rūpāvacara kusala cittas (of the five stages of rūpa-jhāna)
- five rūpāvacara vipākacittas
- five rūpāvacara kiriyacittas
- four arūpāvacara kusala cittas (of the four stages of arūpa-jhāna)
- four arūpāvacara vipākacittas
- four arūpāvacara kiriyacittas
- eight lokuttara cittas

Thus, understanding accompanies fortyseven types of citta in all: twelve
kāmāvacara cittas, fifteen rūpāvacara cittas, twelve arūpāvacara cittas
and eight lokuttara cittas

When forty lokuttara cittas are counted instead of eight, namely,
lokuttara cittas accompanied by the jhāna-factors of the five stages of
jhāna, there are seventynine cittas in all accompanied by understanding.
