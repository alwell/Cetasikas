## Appendix to Chapter 12

### The cittas accompanied by chanda, zeal or wish-to-do

Chanda can be of all four jātis, but as regards the jāti which is
vipāka, chanda accompanies only mahā-vipākacittas, not ahetuka
vipākacittas; as regards the jāti which is kiriya, chanda accompanies
only mahā-kiriyacittas, not ahetuka kiriyacittas. Out of the eighty-nine
cittas, twenty cittas are not accompanied by chanda: the two types of
moha-mūla-citta and the eighteen ahetuka cittas.

Summarizing the cittas which are accompanied by chanda, they are the
following , when cittas are counted as eighty-nine:

- 10 akusala cittas
- 24 kāmāvacara sobhana cittas
- 15 rūpāvacara cittas
- 12 arūpāvacara cittas
- 8 lokuttara cittas

—altogether: 69 cittas

When lokuttara cittas accompanied by the jhānafactors of the different
stages of jhāna are taken into account, there are forty lokuttara cittas
instead of eight. In that case there are hundred-and-one cittas
accompanied by chanda.
