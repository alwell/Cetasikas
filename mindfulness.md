Mindfulness (sati) 
------------------

When we apply ourselves to generosity, dāna, to morality, sīla, or to
mental development, bhāvanā, confidence, saddhā, arises with the kusala
citta. Without confidence in the value of kusala we could not perform
any kind of kusala. Kusala citta does not only need confidence in order
to perform its task, it also needs mindfulness, sati, which is heedful,
non-forgetful, of kusala. There are many opportunities for generosity,
for morality and for mental development, but we are often forgetful of
kusala and we waste such opportunities. When mindfulness arises there is
heedfulness of kusala and then the opportunity for kusala which presents
itself is not wasted. There has to be mindfulness with dāna, with sīla,
with samatha and with the development of insight.

Mindfulness, sati, is one of the nineteen sobhana cetasikas which have
to arise with every sobhana citta. The *Atthasālinī* (I, Part IV,
Chapter I, 121) states that the characteristic of mindfulness is “not
floating away”. Mindfulness “does not allow the floating away of moral
states”, such as the four applications of mindfulness and the other
factors leading to enlightenment. Another characteristic of mindfulness
the *Atthasālinī* mentions is “acquiring” or “taking
up”[(159)](#FOOT159), that is, acquirement of what is useful and
beneficial. Mindfulness, when it arises, “searches well the courses of
states, advantageous and disadvantageous: —’these states are
advantageous, those disadvantageous, these states are serviceable, those
not serviceable’—and then removes the disadvantageous and takes up the
advantageous.”

The *Atthasālinī* then gives another definition of mindfulness:

> …Mindfulness has “not floating away” as its characteristic,
> unforgetfulness as its function, guarding, or the state of facing the
> object, as its manifestation, firm remembrance (saññā) or application
> in mindfulness as regards the body, etc. , as proximate cause. It
> should be regarded as a door-post from being firmly established in the
> object, and as a door-keeper from guarding the door of the senses.

The definition of mindfulness in the *Visuddhimagga* (XIV, 141) is
similar to this definition.

Mindfulness is non-forgetful of what is kusala and it keeps us from
akusala. Also those who do not know about the Dhamma are able to perform
wholesome deeds, but it is through the Dhamma that one can know more
precisely what is kusala and what is akusala. Association with the good
friend in Dhamma, listening to the Dhamma and considering it are most
helpful conditions for mindfulness in the field of dāna, sīla, samatha
and insight, thus, for all levels of mindfulness. The generosity, the
patience and all the other good qualities of the true friend in Dhamma
can remind one to develop such qualities as well.

There are different ways of kusala and in order to be more heedful of
what is wholesome, it is helpful to know more in detail about them.
Dāna, generosity, for example, is not only the giving away of useful
things. There are also other ways of generosity included in dāna, such
as expressing our appreciation of someone else’s kusala (anumodana
dāna). We may be stingy as to words of praise or we are lazy with regard
to kusala and then we let opportunities for such a way of generosity go
by. It is mindfulness which is non-forgetful of this way of generosity
when the opportunity arises. Another form of generosity is to give
someone else, no matter he lives in this world or in some other plane of
existence, the opportunity to rejoice in our good deeds, so that he has
kusala citta as well. It is mindfulness, not self, which is heedful of
kusala. Without mindfulness it is impossible to perform any kind of
kusala.

Abstaining from ill deeds is a way of kusala included in sīla. The
Buddha explained in detail what is right and what is wrong. We should
consider his words and test their meaning. Then we can verify ourselves
the truth of his teachings. Before we studied the Dhamma we may not have
known that also the killing of insects, for example, is akusala. Through
the Dhamma we acquire more understanding of our different cittas, of
kusala cittas and akusala cittas. We come to understand that killing is
motivated by dosa and that the killing of any living being, insects
included, is akusala kamma which can produce akusala vipāka. When we see
the disadvantages of all kinds of akusala there are conditions for the
arising of mindfulness which is heedful, non-forgetful of abstaining
from akusala.

Through the Dhamma we learn about different ways of kusala. Before we
studied the Dhamma we may not have known that politeness and respect are
ways of kusala kamma. Politeness and respect which are expressed by
gestures or words are forms of sīla. When there is an opportunity for
such a way of kusala, mindfulness may arise and be non-forgetful of it,
so that this opportunity is not wasted; that is the function of
mindfulness.

There is not only mindfulness which is non-forgetful of dāna or of sīla,
there is also mindfulness with mental development. The development of
calm, samatha, is one way of mental development. There is mindfulness
with the kusala citta which develops calm. There are many degrees of
calm. Jhāna, absorption, is a high level of calm and it is extremely
difficult to attain this level; one can only attain jhāna if one has
accumulations for it and if there is right understanding of its way of
development. One may have no accumulations for jhāna, but there can be
moments of calm in daily life. For example, if there is right
understanding of the characteristic of loving kindness, which is one of
the meditation subjects of samatha, this quality can be developed in
daily life and then there is calm conditioned by loving kindness. When
there is calm, no matter of what degree, there is also mindfulness of
the object of calm, be it loving kindness, compassion, the recollection
of the Buddha or any other object of samatha.

The study of the Dhamma is included in mental development. When we study
the Dhamma with the aim to have more understanding of realities there is
mindfulness at that moment. When we study the Dhamma and consider it
there is intellectual understanding of realities and this is different
from direct understanding of the reality which appears at the present
moment. Intellectual understanding is a necessary foundation for the
development of direct understanding or insight, vipassanā.

In order to understand what mindfulness of vipassanā is, we should know
what its object is. The object of mindfulness in the development of
vipassanā is the nāma or rūpa which appears at the present moment. Nāma
and rūpa are ultimate realities, different from “conventional realities”
or concepts, such as person, mind, body, animal or tree. Concepts are
objects we can think of but they are not real in the absolute sense.

We should know the difference between ultimate realities and concepts.
If we only know concepts and not ultimate realities we believe that a
person or self really exists. We tend to think of a “whole” of mind and
body, of the human person. When we study the Dhamma we learn that what
we call mind are different types of citta accompanied by different
cetasikas, and that these change all the time. What we call body are
different rūpas, some of which are produced by kamma, some by citta,
some by temperature and some by nutrition. These rūpas arise and then
fall away, they change all the time. Through the study of the Dhamma we
learn about the different conditions for the cittas, cetasikas and rūpas
which arise. For instance, people are born with different bodily
features: some are beautiful, some are ugly, some are strong in body,
some are weak. Such differences are caused by kamma. People have, as we
say in conventional language, different characters, and through the
Dhamma we acquire a more precise understanding of the conditions for
their different characters. People had, in past lives, different
abilities, different inclinations, and these have been accumulated from
one moment of citta to the next moment of citta; therefore, they can
condition the citta arising at the present moment. Kusala cittas and
akusala cittas which arise are conditioned by accumulated inclinations
to wholesomeness and unwholesomeness. We have pleasant experiences and
unpleasant experiences through the senses and these are conditioned
phenomena, they are vipākacittas produced by kamma. When we study the
different conditions for the phenomena which arise we will understand
more clearly that they are only fleeting phenomena, that there is no
person or self who can exert control over the events of life.

We are used to paying attention only to concepts, but through the study
of the Dhamma we learn to see the value of developing understanding of
ultimate realities, of nāma and rūpa. We learn through the study of the
Abhidhamma that the sense-objects are experienced through their
appropriate doorway by cittas which arise in processes. Visible object
is experienced through the eye-door by cittas arising in the eye-door
process. Tangible object such as hardness is experienced through the
body-door by cittas arising in the body-door process. Each object is
experienced through its appropriate doorway; tangible object, for
example, could not be experienced through the eye-door. Only one object
can be experienced at a time, through one doorway; the different
doorways should not be confused with each other. When we only pay
attention to concepts we think, for example, that we can see and touch a
flower. But in reality the seeing sees only what is visible, visible
object, and the body-consciousness experiences tangible object such as
hardness or softness. We can think of a “whole” such as a flower because
of remembrance of different experiences through different doorways. The
thinking is conditioned by seeing and other sense impressions.

Nāma and rūpa appear one at a time and each one of them has its own
characteristic. These characteristics cannot be altered. Seeing, for
example, has its own characteristic; we can give it another name, but
its characteristic cannot be altered. Seeing is always seeing for
everybody, no matter whether an animal or any other living being sees.
Concepts are only objects of thinking, they are not realities with their
own characteristics, and, thus, they are not objects of which right
understanding is to be developed. Nāma and rūpa which are real in the
absolute sense are the objects of which right understanding should be
developed.

Only one reality at a time can be experienced by citta and thus also
mindfulness which accompanies the kusala citta can experience only one
object at a time. Since we are so used to paying attention to “wholes”,
to concepts such as people, cars or trees, we find it difficult to
consider only one reality at a time. When we know the difference between
the moments of thinking of concepts and the moments that only one
reality at a time, such as sound or hardness appears, we will gradually
have more understanding of what mindfulness is.

In order to remind people of the truth of conditioned realities the
Buddha taught about six doors, the objects experienced through these
doorways and the realities which experience these objects. We read, for
example, in the *Middle Length Sayings* (III, no. 148, ”Discourse on the
Six Sixes”) that the Buddha, while he was staying near Sāvatthī, in the
Jeta Grove, explained to the monks:

> …When it is said, “Six internal sense-fields are to be understood”, in
> reference to what is it said? It is in reference to the sense-field of
> eye, the sense-field of ear, the sense-field of nose, the sense-field
> of tongue, the sense-field of body, the sense-field of mind. When it
> is said, “Six internal sense-fields are to be understood”, it is said
> in reference to this. This is the first Six.
>
> When it is said, “Six external sense-fields are to be understood”, in
> reference to what is it said? It is in reference to the sense-field of
> material shapes, the sense-field of sounds, the sense-field of smells,
> the sense-field of tastes, the sense-field of touches, the sense-field
> of mental states. When it is said, “Six external sense-fields are to
> be understood”, it is said in reference to this. This is the second
> Six.
>
> When it is said, “Six classes of consciousness are to be understood”,
> in reference to what is it said? It is in reference to the visual
> consciousness that arises because of eye and material shapes; the
> auditory consciousness that arises because of ear and sounds; the
> olfactory consciousness that arises because of nose and smells; the
> gustatory consciousness that arises because tongue and tastes; the
> bodily consciousness that arises because of body and touches; the
> mental consciousness that arises because of mind and mental states.
> When it is said, “Six classes of consciousness are to be understood”,
> it is said in reference to this. This is the third Six…

We then read about the six classes of impingement (contact or phassa),
about the six classes of feeling conditioned by those impingements and
about the six classes of craving conditioned by the six classes of
feeling. Direct understanding of all these realities which arise because
of their own conditions can eradicate the wrong view of self and can
eventually lead to “turning away”, to detachment from realities.

This sutta reminds us that each reality which appears through one of the
six doors should be known separately, we should not confuse different
realities with each other. We are so used to the idea of seeing people.
However, the only object which can be seen is visible object. If there
is mindfulness of visible object when it appears we will understand that
visible object is a reality which can be experienced through the
eyesense, that it is not a person. We may find it difficult to grasp
this truth and we may wonder whether we have to avoid thinking of
concepts. We do not have to avoid this, then we could not live our daily
life. The citta which thinks of concepts is a reality, it arises because
of conditions and it can be known as only a kind of nāma, not self. We
can live our daily life as usual, thinking of concepts and expressing
ourselves by means of conventional language, in terms of “I”, “self” or
“person”, but at the same time right understanding of nāma and rūpa can
be developed. Even when we think of people and talk to them, there are
nāma and rūpa which appear, and these can be objects of mindfulness.

The cetasika sati, mindfulness, is different from what is meant by
mindfulness in conventional language. Someone may think that he is
mindful when he directs his attention to what he is doing or to what is
going on around him. That is not the characteristic of sati in the
development of insight. Sati of vipassanā is, as we have seen, mindful
of a nāma or a rūpa which appears, without a thought of self who makes a
particular effort or who is directing the attention to an object. Also
sati is only a type of nāma, not self.

When there is mindfulness of a nāma or rūpa which appears, direct
understanding of that reality can at that moment be developed. When we
learn a subject such as mathematics or history, we study books and try
to understand the subject we study. In order to understand realities we
have to investigate or “study” them, but that is not study through
thinking, it is the development of direct understanding of realities.
When a reality such as sound appears and there is mindfulness of it, its
characteristic can be “studied” or investigated, just for an extremely
short moment. In that way it can be known as it is: a conditioned
reality which does not belong to anyone. The word “study” can remind us
that there should be mindfulness of realities again and again, until
they are known as they are. Full understanding cannot be achieved within
a short time.

As we have seen in the definition of the *Atthasālinī*, “guarding” is a
manifestation of mindfulness. Through mindfulness the six doors are
guarded. When there is no mindfulness after having seen visible object
through the eyes, there is bound to be attachment, aversion and
ignorance on account of the object. We are absorbed in the objects which
are experienced through the six doors. When mindfulness arises there is
no akusala citta on account of the object which is experienced and,
thus, the doorways are guarded. The *Atthasālinī* compares mindfulness
with a doorkeeper.

In order to understand the function of mindfulness it is helpful to know
the danger of the absence of mindfulness. The definition of
“Heedlessness” in the *Book of Analysis* (Vibhaṅga, Chapter 17, Analysis
of Small Items, par 846) reminds us of the danger of akusala and the
value of mindfulness which guards the six doors. We read:

> Therein what is “heedlessness”? Wrong bodily action or wrong verbal
> action or wrong mental action or the succumbing and repeated
> succumbing of consciousness to the five strands of sense pleasures or
> not working carefully, not working constantly, working spasmodically,
> being stagnant, relinquishing wish (desire-to-do, chanda),
> relinquishing the task, non-pursuance, non-development,
> non-repetition, non-resolution, non-practising, heedlessness in the
> development of good states; that which is similar, heedlessness, being
> heedless, state of being heedless. This is called heedlessness.

When we are not mindful we succumb repeatedly to the “five strands of
sense pleasures”. The doors of the eye, ear, nose, tongue, bodysense and
the mind-door are not guarded. We are working “spasmodically”, or we are
stagnant; we are lazy as to the development of right understanding. We
cannot force the arising of mindfulness, but when we see the danger of
akusala it can condition non-forgetfulness of the reality appearing at
the present moment. When mindfulness arises there is no “relinquishing
of the task”, namely the task of the development of right understanding.

It may seem uninteresting to investigate realities such as visible
object, seeing, sound or hearing, but we should remember that right
understanding of realities bears directly on our daily life. It can
eliminate wrong bodily action, wrong verbal action and wrong mental
action. When wrong view has been eradicated completely we shall never
again neglect the five precepts since there are no more conditions for
neglecting them. Even when one has not yet become a sotāpanna,
mindfulness can prevent akusala kamma. For instance, when there is an
unpleasant sound, aversion may arise and it could motivate akusala
kamma. Whereas when there is mindfulness of sound as only a kind of
rūpa, not the voice of someone, not the sound of a radio, the doors are
guarded. When mindfulness guards the six doors it is to the benefit of
ourselves as well as of other people.

As we have seen, the *Atthasālinī* states that the proximate cause of
mindfulness is firm remembrance (saññā) or the four applications of
mindfulness (satipaṭṭhāna). There can be mindfulness of the nāma or rūpa
which appears because of firm remembrance of all we learnt from the
teachings about nāma and rūpa. Listening is mentioned in the scriptures
as a most important condition for the attainment of enlightenment,
because when we listen time and again, there can be firm remembrance of
the Dhamma. Mindfulness is different from remembrance, saññā. Saññā
accompanies every citta; it recognizes the object and “marks” it, so
that it can be recognized again. Mindfulness, sati, is not forgetful of
what is wholesome. It arises with sobhana cittas. But when there is sati
which is non-forgetful of dāna, sīla, of the object of calm or, in the
case of vipassanā, of the nāma and rūpa appearing at the present moment,
there is also kusala saññā which remembers the object in the right way,
in the wholesome way.

The other proximate cause of mindfulness is the four applications of
mindfulness or satipaṭṭhāna[(160)](#FOOT160). All realities can be
object of mindfulness in the development of insight and are thus
included in the four applications of mindfulness which are rūpa,
feeling, citta and dhamma. For those who have accumulations to develop
calm to the degree of jhāna and to develop insight as well, also
jhānacitta can be object of mindfulness in vipassanā, in order to see it
as non-self. Right understanding of realities is developed through
mindfulness of any nāma or rūpa which appears now, be it akusala citta,
mahā-kusala citta, jhānacitta or any other reality. One should not try
to direct mindfulness to a particular object; there is no self who can
have power over any reality or who can direct sati. There is not any
reality which is excluded from the four applications of mindfulness.

Mindfulness is one of the “five spiritual faculties” (indriyas) which
should be developed. As we have seen, the other spiritual faculties are:
confidence, energy, concentration and wisdom. We read in the
*Dhammasangaṇi* (par 14) about the faculty of mindfulness:

> What on that occasion is the faculty of mindfulness?
>
> The mindfulness which on that occasion is recollecting, calling back
> to mind; the mindfulness which is remembering, bearing in mind, the
> opposite of superficiality and of obliviousness; mindfulness as
> faculty (indriya), mindfulness as power (bala), right mindfulness—
> this is the faculty of mindfulness that there then is.

The *Atthasālinī* (I, Part IV, Chapter II, 147), in its explanation of
this passage, states about “non-superficiality”:

> …“non-superficiality” (in the sense of diving or entering into the
> object) is the state of not letting the object float away. Not as
> pumpkins and pots, etc., which float on the water and do not sink
> therein, does mindfulness sink into the object. Hence it is said to be
> non-superficiality…

Mindfulness is an indriya, a “controlling faculty”, a “leader” of the
citta and accompanying cetasikas in its function of heedfulness, of
non-forgetfulness of what is wholesome. We read in the *Atthasālinī*, in
the same section:

> …It exercises government (over associated states) in the
> characteristic of presenting or illuminating the object—this is the
> faculty of mindfulness.

Mindfulness is non-forgetful of the object, and understanding (paññā)
has the function of knowing it as it is. Mindfulness, when it is
developed, becomes a power or strength (bala), and then it is unshakable
by its opposite, by forgetfulness. We read in the same section of the
*Atthasālinī* : …It does not fluctuate on account of negligence—this is
“strength of mindfulness”. “Right mindfulness” is irreversible,
emancipating, moral mindfulness.

> The five wholesome controlling faculties, the “spiritual faculties”,
> must be developed in samatha in order to attain jhāna and in vipassanā
> in order to attain enlightenment. It is our nature to be forgetful of
> the reality which appears now, but gradually mindfulness can be
> accumulated. It can even become a “power”.

Right mindfulness is one of the factors of the eightfold Path. It is
“emancipating”; the factors of the eightfold Path lead to freedom from
defilements. Mindfulness is also one of the enlightenment factors
(bojjhangas). The other factors are: investigation of Dhamma (dhamma
vicaya), energy, enthusiasm (pīti), tranquillity (passaddhi),
concentration and equanimity.

One may wonder how, in the development of insight, the faculty of
mindfulness, the power of mindfulness, the Path factor right mindfulness
and the enlightenment factor of mindfulness can be developed. The answer
is: through mindfulness of the nāma and rūpa which appears right now.
There is no other way. Colours, sounds, scents, flavours and tangible
objects are most of the time objects of attachment, aversion and
ignorance. If mindfulness arises and right understanding of the object
is being developed, one is at that moment not enslaved to the object nor
disturbed by it. If we understand that mindfulness of realities can
eventually have an immediate effect on our daily life, we will have more
courage to develop it at this moment.
