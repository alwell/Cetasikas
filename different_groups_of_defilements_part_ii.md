# Different Groups of Defilements Part II


The akusala cetasikas which are attachment, wrong view and ignorance are
classified in different groups: as four cankers, four floods and four
yokes. Each of these groups consists of the same defilements, but
different aspects are shown by these classifications. The cankers flow
or “exude”, or they are like intoxicants. The floods are dangerous, they
can drown us, they sweep us away into the ocean of rebirths. The yokes
tie us to the cycle of birth and death.

There are still other groups of defilements and by their classifications
again different aspects are shown. One of these groups is the *ties* or
*knots*, *ganthas*. Instead of gantha the term *kāyagantha*, *bodily
tie,* is used as well. Kāya which means body refers to the physical body
as well as to the “mental body” (Vis. XXII, 54). The ganthas tie us to
the round of rebirths. We read in the *Atthasālinī* (I, Part I, Chapter
II, 49):

In the knot-group, states which knot or tie in repeated rounds of birth
by way of birth and decease the person in whom they exist are termed
“knots”.

There are four kāyaganthas, “bodily ties” (*Dhammasangaṇi*,
par1135-1140):

1.  the bodily tie of covetousness (abhijjhā kāyagantha)
2.  the bodily tie of ill-will (vyāpāda kāyagantha)
3.  the bodily tie of clinging to rules and rituals or wrong practice
    (sīlabbata parāmāsa kāyagantha)
4.  the bodily tie of dogmatism (idaṃ-saccābhinivesa kāyagantha)

The first tie comprises all kinds of covetousness, all degrees of lobha,
be they gross or subtle. We should know that there can also be lobha in
the form of hopes and expectations: we hope for good health, we hope
that other people will like us, we hope for honour and praise, for
success in our undertakings. All degrees and shades of lobha are a tie
which binds us to the cycle of birth and death.

The tie of ill-will is dosa. All degrees of dosa such as irritation,
ill-temper, ill-will or hostility are a tie which binds us to the round
of rebirths.

The tie of clinging to rules and rituals is wrong practice and this is a
form of wrong view. People are entangled by this tie when they
erroneously believe that, in order to develop the way leading to
enlightenment, they have to follow certain rules such as abstaining from
particular kinds of food or refraining from reading or talking. So long
as wrong view has not been eradicated one may have many moments of wrong
practice, and one may mistake the wrong practice for the right practice.
People may cling to particular places or situations as being favourable
for the development of satipaṭṭhāna. They believe that mindfulness can
only arise in such places or situations. Then there is bound to be wrong
practice. If we know when there is wrong practice we can be cured of it.

The tie of dogmatism (idaṃ-saccābhinivesa, the belief: this alone is
truth) comprises all forms of wrong view, except wrong practice which is
the third tie, as we have seen. People are entangled by the fourth tie
when they have a wrong interpretation of reality and when they believe
that only their interpretation is the truth. When someone, for example,
believes that there is no kamma and no result of kamma, he is entangled
by the fourth tie. The view that there is no kamma and no result of
kamma is very dangerous, it can condition unwholesome deeds. One may
believe that, after death, one will be annihilated, that there is no
rebirth. Then one is entangled by the fourth tie.

As we have seen, wrong view, diṭṭhi, has been classified as canker, as
flood, as yoke and as (bodily) tie. Under the aspect of tie diṭṭhi has
been classified as twofold: as wrong practice and as false view.

The magga-citta of the sotāpanna eradicates the third and the fourth
ties. The sotāpanna knows the right Path and he cannot deviate from it
anymore, he has no conditions for wrong practice. He has no wrong view
of realities. He still has the first tie, covetousness, and the second
tie, ill-will, but they are not of the degree that they lead to an
unhappy rebirth.

The magga-citta of the anāgāmī eradicates the second tie, ill-will. As
regards the first tie, the anāgāmī does not cling to sensuous objects,
but he has not eradicated the more subtle forms of clinging, which is
clinging to rebirth in rūpa-brahma planes and arūpa-brahma planes. Thus,
he still clings to rebirth. He has not eradicated the first tie.

The magga-citta of the arahat eradicates the first tie. He has no more
clinging, no clinging to rebirth; he is no longer entangled by any of
the four ties.

Another group of defilements is the *ways of clinging* or *upādāna*.
There are four ways of clinging (*Dhammasangaṇi*, par1213-1217):

1.  sensuous clinging (kāmupādāna)
2.  clinging to wrong view (diṭṭhupādāna)
3.  clinging to “rules and rituals” (sīlabbatupādāna)
4.  clinging to personality belief (attavādupādāna)

The first way of clinging, sensuous clinging, comprises clinging to all
the objects which can be experienced through the senses
(*Visuddhimagga*, XVII, 243). We should scrutinize ourselves whether
there is clinging at this moment. We may not notice that there is
clinging very often, after seeing, hearing, smelling, tasting, touching
or on account of the experience of an object through the mind-door. When
we sit on a soft chair there is likely to be clinging already to
softness, but we do not notice it. We look at birds, dogs and cats and
we do not notice that we tend to cling already before we define what it
is that is seen. At the moment of clinging we create a new condition for
life to go on in the cycle of birth and death. Clinging is one of the
links in the “Dependant Origination” (Paṭiccasamuppāda), the conditional
arising of phenomena in the round of rebirths. Because of craving
(taṇhā) there is clinging or firm grasping (upādāna). So long as there
is any form of clinging we have to continue to be in the cycle of birth
and death.

We read in the *Kindred Sayings* (II, Kindred Sayings on Cause, Chapter
5, par52, Grasping, Upādāna):

> While staying at Sāvatthī the Exalted One said:–
>
> In him, monks, who contemplates the enjoyment that there is in all
> that makes for grasping, craving grows. Grasping is conditioned by
> craving. Becoming is conditioned by grasping. Birth is conditioned by
> becoming. Decay-and-death is conditioned by birth. Grief, lamentation,
> suffering, sorrow, despair come to pass. Such is the uprising of this
> entire mass of ill.

The Buddha then uses a simile of a bonfire which keeps on burning so
long as it is supplied with fuel. If there is no fuel the fire will
become extinct. We read further on:

> Even so in him who contemplates the misery that there is in all that
> makes for grasping, craving ceases, and hence grasping ceases,
> becoming, birth, decay-and-death, and sorrow cease. Such is the
> ceasing of this entire mass of ill.

We want to go on living and experiencing objects through the senses,
this is beyond control. However, the Buddha’s words about the
impermanence of all conditioned things, about decay and death, can
remind us of what life really is: only fleeting phenomena.

The other three ways of clinging are forms of wrong view. As regards
clinging to wrong view (diṭṭhupādāna), this comprises clinging to false
views about kamma and the result of kamma, and to other speculative
theories. As regards clinging to wrong practice, when someone takes the
wrong practice for the right practice there are no conditions for the
development of right understanding of realities and thus wrong view
cannot be eradicated. Wrong practice is also one of the “ties”, as we
have seen.

Clinging to personality belief is a form of wrong view which arises when
one firmly believes that the five khandhas are “self”. We can think of
concepts such as “body” or “mind” but there may not necessarily be wrong
view. However, the latent tendency of wrong view has not been eradicated
so long as one has not become a sotāpanna. We all have accumulated
personality belief and when there are conditions it can arise. Someone
may cling with wrong view to the rūpa-kkhandha, he may take the body for
self. When one becomes older and suffers from sickness, it is obvious
that the body changes, but there may still be clinging to an idea of the
body which belongs to a “self”. What is taken for “my body” consists of
different rūpas which arise and fall away. When we are walking,
standing, sitting or lying down, it is not “my body” which can be
directly experienced, there are only different elements, rūpas, such as
hardness, softness, heat or cold, and these can be experienced one at a
time. When mindfulness arises it can be aware of one reality at a time
and in this way right understanding can develop and the wrong view of
self can eventually be eradicated.

Someone may take the khandha of feeling for self, but feeling changes
all the time. Feeling which arises now is not the same as feeling a
moment ago. The khandha of perception or remembrance (saññā) is
different each moment, but one may be inclined to take it for self. When
we recognize or remember something, it is not self who does so, but
saññā. Saṅkhārakkhandha, the khandha of “formations” or “activities”
(all cetasikas other than feeling and saññā), changes all the time;
sometimes akusala cetasikas arise, sometimes kusala cetasikas, but one
may still be inclined to take cetasikas for self. Viññāṇakkhandha,
consciousness, changes all the time; there are seeing, hearing and
thinking of concepts at different moments, but there can be a
deep-rooted belief of “I see”, “I hear”, “I think”. In reality the
seeing sees, the hearing hears, and another citta again thinks of
concepts, they are all different cittas which are not self. There are
different cittas which arise and fall away, one at a time, and each of
them experiences just one object. There may be theoretical understanding
of the truth, but wrong view is deeply rooted; it cannot be eradicated
by thinking. Wrong view can be eradicated only by developing right
understanding of the reality which appears at the present moment.

Among the ways of clinging, clinging to wrong view has been classified
as threefold: as clinging to wrong view (speculative theories), as
clinging to wrong practice and as clinging to personality belief. Each
of these three classifications shows a different aspect of wrong view.

The magga-citta of the sotāpanna eradicates the three ways of clinging
which are clinging to wrong view. He still has the first way of
clinging, sensuous clinging. Even the sakadāgāmī and the anāgāmī have
the first way of clinging. The anāgāmī has no more clinging to sensuous
objects, but he still has clinging to rebirth which is the result of
jhāna, and this form of clinging is in this classification included in
the first way of clinging. The magga-citta of the arahat eradicates the
first way of clinging (Visuddhimagga, XVII, 245).

The *Hindrances* or *Nīvaraṇas* are another group of defilements. In the
*Dhammasangaṇi* (par1152-1163) the hindrances are classified as sixfold:

1.  sensuous desire (kāmacchanda)
2.  ill will (vyāpāda)
3.  sloth and torpor (thīna-middha)
4.  restlessness and regret (uddhacca-kukkucca)
5.  doubt (vicikicchā)
6.  ignorance (avijjā)[(138)](#FOOT138)

In the suttas and in the *Visuddhimagga* (IV, 104, 105) the hindrances
are classified as fivefold; ignorance is not among them. However, this
should not be seen as a discrepancy. Classifications are not rigid,
their aim is to remind us of reality.

The hindrances are obstructions, overwhelming the mind, weakening
insight [(139)](#FOOT139). The hindrances obstruct the development of
what is wholesome. When we are attached to pleasant sights and sounds,
to people or to particular places, there is the hindrance of *sensuous
desire*. At the moment of attachment we do not realize that it obstructs
the arising of kusala citta, but we should know that at such a moment
there cannot be generosity or loving kindness.

*Ill will* is another akusala dhamma which is one of the hindrances. The
hindrance of ill will is dosa cetasika and it comprises all shades and
degrees of aversion. Even a moment of slight annoyance is a hindrance,
it obstructs kusala. When there is ill-will there is no loving-kindness,
no compassion, no understanding of nāma and rūpa. However, some moments
later mindfulness can arise and be aware of any reality which appears,
even of annoyance.

*Sloth* and *torpor* are two akusala cetasikas which are classified as a
pair among the hindrances. When they arise there is mental indisposition
and unwieldiness. They have the same proximate cause, namely, unwise
attention. When there are sloth and torpor there is no energy, no vigour
for kusala, and thus they obstruct kusala. When there are sloth and
torpor one has no confidence in the development of right understanding.

*Restlessness* and *regret* (uddhacca-kukkucca) is another pair among
the hindrances. When there is restlessness and regret the citta is not
peaceful. As we have seen, restlessness accompanies each akusala citta
and regret accompanies only dosa-mūla-citta. The omission of kusala and
the commission of akusala are the objects of regret. Restlessness and
regret obstruct the performing of kusala, and at such moments there
cannot be mindfulness of nāma and rūpa.

*Doubt* (vicikicchā) is another akusala dhamma which is a hindrance.
Doubt about the Buddha, the Dhamma and the Sangha, doubt about
realities, all these kinds of doubt are a hindrance to the development
of kusala, a hindrance to the development of right understanding. We
need courage to continue to develop satipaṭṭhāna, so that doubt can
eventually be eradicated. Doubt is a reality and thus it can be the
object of sati. The citta which is accompanied by mindfulness is kusala
citta, but mindfulness can have as its object any reality which appears,
even akusala dhamma.

*Ignorance* (avijjā) can, as we have seen, also be classified as a
hindrance. There is ignorance with each akusala citta, ignorance is the
root of all evil. Ignorance blinds us, it is a hindrance to kusala and
to right understanding. We may see the danger of lobha and of dosa, but
we may not see the danger of ignorance. If we see its danger we will
develop right understanding so that ignorance can eventually be
eradicated.

In samatha the hindrances can be temporarily subdued by the
jhāna-factors which accompany the jhāna-cittas of the different stages
of jhāna, but they cannot be eradicated. They can be eradicated only by
the right understanding which is developed in vipassanā.

We read in the *Kindred Sayings* (V, Mahā-vagga, Book II, Kindred
Sayings on the Limbs of Wisdom, Chapter IV, par5) about the condition
for the arising of the hindrances:

> Monks, in him who practises unsystematic attention, sensual desire, if
> not already arisen, arises; and, if already arisen, sensual desire
> conduces to the more-becoming and growth thereof.
>
> So also malevolence, sloth and torpor, excitement and flurry, doubt
> and wavering, if not yet arisen, do arise; and, if arisen, conduce to
> the more-becoming and growth thereof.

In the following sutta we read that systematic attention (wise
attention) conditions the arising of the “limbs of wisdom” which, if
they have arisen, by cultivation go to fulfilment. The “limbs of
wisdom”, which are also called the “factors of enlightenment”
(bojjhangas), are: mindfulness, investigation of Dhamma (dhamma-vicaya),
energy, rapture, tranquillity, concentration and equanimity.

Further on, in the same section (par8), we read again about the
hindrances which weaken insight and about the “limbs of wisdom” which
conduce to realizing the fruits of liberation by knowledge. We read:

> Now, monks, at the time when the ariyan disciple makes the Dhamma his
> object, gives attention to it, with all his mind considers it, with
> ready ear listens to the Dhamma,—at such a time these five hindrances
> do not exist in him; at such a time the seven limbs of wisdom by
> cultivation go to fulfilment.

This sutta reminds us of the great value of listening to the Dhamma and
carefully and thoroughly considering it, in order to be able to apply
it.

The hindrances are eradicated at different stages of enlightenment. The
magga-citta of the sotāpanna eradicates doubt. Since the sotāpanna has
no more wrong view and sees realities as they are, there cannot be any
doubt about them. The magga-citta of the anāgāmī eradicates sensuous
desire, ill will and regret. The magga-citta of the arahat eradicates
sloth and torpor, restlessness and ignorance. The arahat is free of all
the hindrances. Defilements can only be eradicated stage by stage
because they are so deeply rooted.

In order to eradicate defilements we should have patience to develop
understanding gradually. It is essential to know the difference between
the moments we are absorbed in thinking of concepts, such as people and
possessions, situations or events of life, and the moments of
mindfulness which is aware of only one reality at a time as it presents
itself through one of the six doors. We should not try to suppress
thinking, it is real; it arises because it is conditioned. Thinking can
be object of mindfulness, it can be known as a type of nāma, arising
because of its own conditions, not self. There is not only thinking,
there are also seeing, visible object, hearing or sound, but we are
mostly forgetful of these realities. We are used to paying attention
only to concepts, but gradually we can learn to be mindful of realities.
We cannot expect to have full understanding of realities at once. If we
are intent only on what appears at the present moment we do not worry
about the fact that understanding will have to be developed for a long
time, even for many lives. There is no self who has understanding, it is
understanding, paññā cetasika, which can develop and see things as they
really are. We tend to forget that paññā is a conditioned nāma.

We read in the *Kindred Sayings* (II, Niddāna-vagga, Chapter XXI,
Kindred Sayings about Brethren, par6, 11, 12) about different monks who
attained arahatship. They had to develop right understanding life after
life. The Buddha repeatedly said that it was “no easy matter” to attain
the goal. We read for example about Kappina (par11) that the Buddha
said:

> …That monk is highly gifted, of wondrous power. No easy matter is it
> to win that which he formerly had not won, even that for the sake of
> which clansmen rightly leave the home for the homeless, even that
> uttermost goal of the divine living which he has attained, wherein he
> abides, having come just here and now to know it thoroughly for
> himself and to realize it.

### Questions

1.  When does the “bodily tie of dogmatism” arise?
2.  Is it a discrepancy that the hindrances are sometimes classified as
    fivefold, ignorance being excluded, and sometimes as sixfold?
3.  Why is even a slight annoyance a hindrance to kusala?
4.  Why can wrong view about seeing, hearing or thinking only be
    eliminated by paññā as they appear in daily life?
