Applied thinking (vitakka)
--------------------------

*Vitakka,* applied thinking or initial thinking, and *vicāra,* sustained
thinking or sustained application, are two cetasikas among the
“particulars”[(51)](#FOOT51) . We believe that we know what thinking is.
We think of what we have seen, heard, smelt, tasted or experienced
through the bodysense, or we think of ideas and concepts. We build up
long stories of what we experienced and we cling to thinking. In order
to know the realities of vitakka and vicāra we should not be misled by
the conventional term “thinking”. Through the study of the Abhidhamma
and the commentaries we can acquire a more precise knowledge of
realities.

The *Visuddhimagga* ( IV, 88) defines vitakka as follows:

> …Herein, applied thinking (vitakkama) is applied thought (vitakka);
> hitting upon, is what is meant. It has the characteristic of directing
> the mind onto an object (mounting the mind on its object). Its
> function is to strike at and thresh—for the meditator[(52)](#FOOT52)
> is said, in virtue of it, to have the object touched and struck at by
> applied thought. It is manifested as the leading of the mind onto an
> object…

The *Atthasālinī* (Book I, Part IV, Chapter I, 114) gives a similar
definition. This commentary uses a simile of someone who wants to
“ascend” the king’s palace and depends on a relative or friend dear to
the king to achieve this. In the same way the citta which is accompanied
by vitakka depends on the latter in order to “ascend” to the object, to
be directed to the object. Vitakka leads the citta to the object so that
citta can cognize it.

In order to know more about vitakka, we should learn which cittas are
accompanied by vitakka. We may think that vitakka accompanies only
cittas arising in a mind-door process, but this is not so. Vitakka
arises in sense-door processes as well as in mind-door processes.
Vitakka accompanies all kāmāvacara cittas (cittas of the sense-sphere),
except the dvi-pañcaviññāṇas (the five pairs which are seeing, hearing,
etc.).

We may wonder why vitakka does not arise with the dvi-pañcaviññāṇas.
When seeing arises it performs the function of seeing, it sees visible
object and it does not need vitakka in order to see. The other cittas of
the eye-door process need vitakka in order to experience visible object,
they do not see. The eye-door adverting-consciousness does not see, it
adverts to visible object and it needs vitakka which directs it to
visible object. It is the same with the other cittas of that process. As
regards the other sense-door processes, the dvi-pañcaviññāṇas do not
need vitakka in order to experience the object, but all the other cittas
of these processes have to be accompanied by vitakka. All cittas of the
mind-door process are accompanied by vitakka.

Vitakka accompanies not only cittas arising in processes, it also
accompanies cittas which do not arise in processes: the paṭisandhi-citta
(rebirth-consciousness), the bhavanga-citta (life-continuum) and the
cuti-citta (dying-consciousness).

When vitakka accompanies kusala citta, vitakka is also kusala, and when
it accompanies akusala citta it is also akusala. When we are not
applying ourselves to kusala, we act, speak or think with akusala citta
and thus the accompanying vitakka is also akusala. It is not often that
we are performing acts of generosity, that we apply ourselves to sīla
(good moral conduct) or to bhāvanā (mental development). There are many
more akusala cittas in our life than kusala cittas and thus akusala
vitakka is bound to arise very often. When we are attached to a pleasant
object there is akusala vitakka which “touches” that object. Or when
there is even a slight feeling of annoyance when things are not the way
we want them to be, there is sure to be dosa-mūla-citta and this is
accompanied by akusala vitakka which performs its function.

There are three kinds of *akusala vitakka* which are mentioned in
particular in the suttas. They are

-   thought of sense-pleasures (kāma-vitakka)
-   thought of malevolence (vyāpāda-vitakka)
-   thought of harming (vihiṁsā-vitakka)

We read in the “Discourse on the Twofold Thought” (Middle Length Sayings
I, no. 19) that the Buddha, while he was still a Bodhisatta, considered
both akusala vitakka and kusala vitakka. We read that when the thought
of sense-pleasures arose, he comprehended thus:

> …“This thought of sense-pleasures has arisen in me, but it conduces to
> self-hurt and it conduces to the hurt of others and it conduces to the
> hurt of both, it is destructive of intuitive wisdom, associated with
> distress, not conducive to nibbāna.” But while I was reflecting, “It
> conduces to self-hurt”, it subsided; and while I was reflecting, “It
> conduces to the hurt of others”, it subsided; and while I was
> reflecting, “It is destructive of intuitive wisdom, it is associated
> with distress, it is not conducive to nibbāna”, it subsided. So I,
> monks, kept on getting rid of the thought of sense-pleasures as it
> constantly arose, I kept on driving it out, I kept on making an end of
> it…

The same is said about the thought of malevolence and the thought of
harming. We then read:

> …Monks, according to whatever a monk ponders and reflects on much, his
> mind in consequence gets a bias that way. Monks, if a monk ponder and
> reflect much on thought of sense-pleasures he ejects thought of
> renunciation; if he makes much of the thought of sense-pleasures, his
> mind inclines to the thought of sense-pleasures. Monks, if a monk
> ponder and reflect much on the thought of malevolence…he ejects the
> thought of non-malevolence… his mind inclines to the thought of
> malevolence. Monks, if a monk ponder and reflect much on the thought
> of harming, he ejects the thought of non-harming; if he makes much of
> the thought of harming, his mind inclines to the thought of harming…

It is useful to know on what we reflect most of the time. We have a bias
towards akusala, since we have accumulated so much akusala. We are more
inclined to unwholesome thoughts and therefore it is difficult to have
wholesome thoughts. When there is a pleasant object the thought of
sense-pleasures arises almost immediately. When there is an unpleasant
object there is bound to be a thought of annoyance or malice, or there
can even be a thought of harming. When someone else receives praise and
honour, we may be inclined to jealousy and then there is akusala vitakka
accompanying the dosa-mūla-citta with jealousy. It is difficult to
cultivate kusala vitakka but the Buddha showed that it can be done.
Further on in the sutta we read about three kinds of kusala vitakka
which are the opposites of the three kinds of akusala vitakka. They are:

-   the thought of renunciation (nekkhamma)
-   the thought of non-malevolence (avyāpāda)
-   the thought of non-harming (avihiṁsa)

The Bodhisatta realized that these lead neither to self-hurt, nor to the
hurt of others, nor to the hurt of both, but that they are for “growth
in intuitive wisdom”, that they are “not associated with distress”,
“conducive to nibbāna”. We read about kusala vitakka:

> …Monks, if a monk ponder and reflect much on the thought of
> renunciation he ejects the thought of sense-pleasures; if he makes
> much of the thought of renunciation, his mind inclines to the thought
> of renunciation. Monks, if a monk ponder and reflect much on the
> thought of non-malevolence he ejects the thought of malevolence…
> Monks, if a monk ponder and reflect much on the thought of
> non-harming, he ejects the thought of harming; if he makes much of the
> thought of non-harming his mind inclines to the thought of
> non-harming…

One may wonder whether nekkhamma, renunciation, is the same as
retirement from worldly life and whether it therefore pertains in
particular to monks. Although a monk’s life should be a life of
contentment with little, he may not be cultivating nekkhamma. Whoever
has not eradicated attachment to sense objects has still conditions for
“thought of sense-pleasures”, no matter whether he is a monk or a
layman. When a monk receives delicious almsfood, is attachment not
likely to arise?

There are many degrees of nekkhamma and not only monks should cultivate
it, but laypeople as well. Actually, *all kusala dhammas are
nekkhamma*[(53)](#FOOT53). When we perform dāna, observe sīla or apply
ourselves to mental development, we are at such moments not absorbed in
sense-pleasures, there is renunciation. We can experience that when
there is loving kindness or compassion we do not think of ourselves;
thus, there is a degree of detachment. If we see the disadvantages of
being selfish, of thinking of our own pleasure and comfort, there are
more conditions for being attentive to others. Detachment from the
concept of self is still a higher degree of renunciation which can be
achieved through the development of right understanding of realities.
Both monks and laypeople should cultivate this kind of renunciation.
When the concept of self has been eradicated, stinginess has been
eradicated as well, and thus, there are more conditions for generosity.
Moreover, sīla will be purer, there will be no more conditions for
transgressing the five precepts.


Sustained Thinking (vicāra)
-------------------------------

*Vicāra* can be translated as sustained thinking, discursive thinking or
sustained application. We read in the *Visuddhimagga* (IV, 88) the
following definition:

> …Sustained thinking (vicaraṇa) is sustained thought (vicāra);
> continued sustenance (anusañcaraṇa), is what is meant. It has the
> characteristic of continued pressure on (occupation with) the object.
> Its function is to keep conascent (mental) states (occupied) with
> that. It is manifested as keeping consciousness anchored (on that
> object).

The *Atthasālinī* (Book One, Part IV, Chapter I, 114) defines vicāra in
a similar way.

Vicāra is not the same reality as vitakka. Vitakka directs the citta to
the object and vicāra keeps the citta occupied with the object,
“anchored” on it. However, we should remember that both vitakka and
vicāra perform their functions only for the duration of one citta and
then fall away immediately, together with the citta. Both the
*Visuddhimagga* and the *Atthasālinī* use similes in order to explain
the difference between vitakka and vicāra. Vitakka is gross and vicāra
is more subtle. We read in the *Visuddhimagga* ( IV, 89):

> …Applied thought (vitakka) is the first compact of the mind in the
> sense that it is both gross and inceptive, like the striking of a
> bell. Sustained thought (vicāra) is the act of keeping the mind
> anchored, in the sense that it is subtle with the individual essence
> of continued pressure, like the ringing of the bell…

Several more similes are used in order to explain the difference between
vitakka and vicāra. Vitakka is like the bird’s spreading out its wings
when about to soar into the air, and vicāra is quiet, like the bird’s
planing with outspread wings. When we read this simile we may think that
vitakka has to come first and that then vicāra follows. However, this
simile is used in order to show that vitakka and vicāra have different
characteristics.

Another simile the *Visuddhimagga* and the *Atthasālinī* use is the
following : vitakka is like the bee’s diving towards a lotus and vicāra
is like the bee’s gyrating around the lotus after it has dived towards
it.

Like vitakka, vicāra arises with all kāmāvacara cittas, cittas of the
sense-sphere, except the dvi-pañcaviññāṇas (the sense-cognitions of
seeing, hearing, etc.). When seeing-consciousness, for example, arises,
it does not need vitakka nor does it need vicāra, because
seeing-consciousness just sees. The other cittas of the eye-door process
need vitakka which directs them to visible object and they need vicāra
which keeps them occupied with visible object. It is the same in the
case of the other sense-door processes. Vitakka and vicāra arise in
sense-door processes as well as in mind-door processes, and they also
accompany cittas which do not arise in processes[(54)](#FOOT54) .

Vitakka and vicāra are conditioned dhammas, *saṅkhāra dhammas,* which
arise and fall away together with the citta they accompany. They perform
their functions only during an extremely short moment, namely the
duration of one citta. Their object can be a paramattha dhamma or a
concept. We may wonder how vitakka and vicāra perform their functions
while we are engaged with the thinking of “stories”. It seems that
thinking can last for a while, but in reality there are many cittas
accompanied by vitakka and vicāra and other cetasikas, which arise and
fall away, succeeding one another. It is because of saññā, remembrance,
that we can remember the previous thought and that different thoughts
can be connected.

Both *vitakka* and *vicāra* are *jhāna-factors* which can be developed
in samatha, tranquil meditation. The jhāna-factors are sobhana
(beautiful) cetasikas which are developed in order to inhibit the
“hindrances”, defilements which obstruct the attainment of jhāna,
absorption. Vitakka which is developed in samatha “thinks” of the
meditation subject and it inhibits the hindrances which are *sloth* and
*torpor* (thīna and middha). The *Visuddhimagga* states in the
definition of vitakka (IV, 88) :

“…for the meditator is said, in virtue of it, to have the object struck
at by applied thought, threshed by applied thought...”

Thus, in samatha vitakka “touches” the meditation subject again and
again until calm has developed to the degree that jhāna can be attained.

As regards the jhāna-factor vicāra which is developed in samatha, this
keeps the citta “anchored on” the meditation subject and inhibits the
hindrance which is *doubt.* As we have seen, in the case of kāmāvacara
cittas, both vitakka and vicāra arise together when they accompany the
citta. In the case of jhānacittas however, a distinction has to be made.
In the first stage of jhāna both vitakka and vicāra are needed in order
to experience the meditation subject with absorption. Thus, both vitakka
and vicāra accompany the rūpāvacara kusala citta, the rūpāvacara
vipākacitta and the rūpāvacara kiriyacitta of the first stage of
jhāna[(55)](#FOOT55). In the second stage of jhāna one has acquired more
skill in jhāna and vitakka is no longer needed in order to experience
the meditation subject with absorption. At that stage vitakka has been
abandoned, but vicāra still arises. In the subsequent stage of jhāna,
which is more tranquil and more refined, also vicāra has been abandoned;
it is no longer needed in order to experience the meditation subject
with absorption. Some people have abandoned both vitakka and vicāra in
the second stage of jhāna and thus for them there are only four stages
of rūpa-jhāna instead of five. That is why the stages of jhāna can be
counted in accordance with the *four-fold system* or the *five-fold
system*.

When we consider the jhāna-factors vitakka and vicāra we may be able to
understand that vitakka is more gross than vicāra. Vitakka is needed in
the first stage of jhāna but it is abandoned in the second stage of
jhāna which is more tranquil and more refined. Vicāra which is more
subtle than vitakka still accompanies the jhānacitta of the second stage
of jhāna. The person who has accumulated conditions to attain jhāna must
be able to distinguish between different jhāna-factors such as vitakka
and vicāra and this is most intricate. This shows us how difficult it is
to develop calm to the degree of jhāna.

The more we study the realities which are taught in the Abhidhamma, the
more we see that there are many different phenomena which each have
their own characteristic. They appear one at a time, but when we try to
name them there is thinking of a concept instead of mindfulness of a
characteristic. Sometimes a reality which thinks may appear and then we
may doubt whether it is vitakka or vicāra. It is useless to try to find
out which reality appears because at such a moment there is no
awareness. Thinking has a characteristic which can be realized when it
appears and then there is no need to name it vitakka or vicāra.

There is yet another aspect of vitakka. Vitakka is one of the *factors
of the eightfold Path* and as such it is called: *sammā-saṅkappa*, right
thinking. Sammā-saṅkappa has to arise together with sammā-diṭṭhi, right
understanding, in order to be a factor of the eightfold
Path[(56)](#FOOT56). When there is right understanding of a nāma or rūpa
which appears, there are both vitakka and vicāra accompanying the citta,
but vicāra is not a factor of the eightfold Path. Sammā-saṅkappa has its
specific function as path-factor. Sammā-saṅkappa “touches” the nāma or
rūpa which appears so that sammā-diṭṭhi can investigate its
characteristic in order to understand it as it is. Thus, sammā-diṭṭhi
needs the assistance of sammā-saṅkappa in order to develop. In the
beginning, when paññā has not been developed, there cannot yet be clear
understanding of the difference between the characteristic of nāma and
of rūpa. When, for example, sound appears, there is also hearing, the
reality which experiences sound, but it is difficult to know the
difference between the characteristic of sound and the characteristic of
hearing, between rūpa and nāma. Only one reality at a time can be object
of mindfulness and when they seem to “appear” together it is evident
that there is not right mindfulness. Only when there is right
mindfulness of one reality at a time right understanding can develop. At
that moment sammā-saṅkappa performs its function of “touching” the
object of mindfulness.

When there is sammā-saṅkappa there is no akusala vitakka, wrong
thinking; there is no “thought of sense-pleasures”, no “thought of
malice”, no “thought of harming”. When the eightfold Path is being
developed the four noble Truths will be known and “unprofitable
thoughts” will eventually be eradicated. We read in the “Kindred
Sayings” (V, Mahā-vagga, Book XII, Chapter I, par7, thoughts) that the
Buddha, while he was at Sāvatthī, said to the monks:

> Monks, think not evil, unprofitable thoughts, such as: thoughts of
> lust, thoughts of hatred, thoughts of delusion. Why do I say so?
>
> Because, monks, these thoughts are not concerned with profit, they are
> not the rudiments of the holy life, they conduce not to revulsion, to
> dispassion, to cessation, to tranquillity, to full understanding, to
> the perfect wisdom, they conduce not to nibbāna.
>
> When you do think, monks, you should think thus: This is dukkha. This
> is the arising of dukkha. This is the ceasing of dukkha. This is the
> practice that leads to the ceasing of dukkha. Why do I say this?
>
> Because, monks, these thoughts are concerned with profit, they are
> rudiments of the holy life…they conduce to nibbāna.
>
> Wherefore an effort must be made to realize: This is dukkha. This is
> the arising of dukkha. This is the ceasing of dukkha. This is the
> practice that leads to the ceasing of dukkha.

The “thinking” referred to in this sutta is not thinking about the four
noble Truths. It refers to the direct realization of the four noble
Truths which are: dukkha, which is suffering, its origin, which is
craving, its cessation, which is nibbāna, and the way leading to its
cessation, which is the eightfold Path. When there is right mindfulness
of a reality which appears, sammā-saṅkappa “touches” it and then paññā
can investigate its characteristic in order to know it as it is. This is
the way to eventually realize the four noble Truths. At the moment of
enlightenment the four noble Truths are penetrated. When the citta is
lokuttara citta, sammā-saṅkappa is also lokuttara. It “touches” nibbāna.
