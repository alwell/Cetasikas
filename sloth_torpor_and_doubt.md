Sloth (thīna), Torpor (middha)
------------------------------

Thīna and middha are two akusala cetasikas which always arise together,
they form a pair. Thīna can be translated as sloth or stolidity and
middha as torpor or languor. When there are sloth and torpor one has no
energy for kusala. In order to have more understanding of sloth and
torpor we should study their characteristics, functions, manifestations
and their proximate cause, and we should know which types of citta they
can accompany.

The *Atthasālinī* (II, Book I, Part IX, Chapter II, 255) states about
sloth and torpor: “Absence of striving, difficulty through inability, is
the meaning.” We then read the following definitions of sloth and
torpor:

> The compound “sloth-torpor” is sloth plus torpor; of which sloth has
> absence of, or opposition to striving as characteristic, destruction
> of energy as function, sinking of associated states as manifestation;
> torpor has unwieldiness as characteristic, closing the doors of
> consciousness as function, shrinking in taking the object, or
> drowsiness as manifestation; and both have unsystematic thought, in
> not arousing oneself from discontent and laziness (or indulgence), as
> proximate cause.

The *Visuddhimagga* (XIV, 167) gives a similar definition. The
*Dhammasangaṇi* calls sloth (thīna) indisposition and unwieldiness of
mind (par1156) and torpor (middha) indisposition and unwieldiness of
cetasikas (par1157) [(128)](#FOOT128). When there are sloth and torpor
there is no wieldiness of mind which is necessary for the performing of
kusala. Instead there are mental stiffness and rigidity, mental sickness
and laziness.

As we have seen, the *Atthasālinī* states that the characteristic of
sloth is opposition to “striving”, to energy. Also akusala citta is
accompanied by energy (viriya), but this is wrong effort; it is
different from right effort which accompanies kusala citta. When there
are sloth and torpor there is no energy, no vigour to perform dāna, to
observe sīla, to listen to Dhamma, to study the Dhamma or to develop
calm, no energy to be mindful of the reality which appears now. This
does not mean that whenever there is lack of mindfulness sloth and
torpor arise. As we will see, they do not arise with all types of
akusala citta.

As regards torpor, its characteristic is unwieldiness and its function
is closing the doors of consciousness. It obstructs the performing of
kusala, it “oppresses…, it injures by means of unwieldiness”, the
*Atthasālinī* (378) explains. The manifestation of sloth is “sinking of
associated states”, it causes the citta and cetasikas it accompanies to
decline. The manifestation of torpor is “shrinking in taking the object”
or drowsiness. The *Dhammasangaṇi* (par1157) calls torpor (middha)
“drowsiness, sleep, slumbering, somnolence”. The *Atthasālinī* (378)
adds to drowsiness: “Drowsiness makes blinking of the eyelashes, etc.”
The arahat has eradicated sloth and torpor. He can still have bodily
tiredness and he may sleep, but he has no sloth and torpor
[(129)](#FOOT129).

We may be inclined to think that sloth and torpor arise only when there
is sleepiness, but when we study the types of citta which can be
accompanied by sloth and torpor we will see that there can be many
moments of them, also when we do not feel sleepy.

As we have seen, the proximate cause of sloth and torpor is
“unsystematic thought, in not arousing oneself from discontent and
laziness”. When there are sloth and torpor there is “unsystematic
thought”, that is, unwise attention (ayoniso manasikāra) to the object
which is experienced. At such moments we do not realize that life is
short and that it is urgent to develop all kinds of kusala and in
particular right understanding of realities. We all have moments that
there is no energy to read the scriptures or to consider the Dhamma. We
may be overcome by boredom, we are not interested to study and to
consider the Dhamma, or we make ourselves believe that we are too busy.
Sometimes, however, we may realize that even the reading of a few lines
of the scriptures can be most beneficial, that it can remind us to be
aware of realities which appear. We should remember that when there are
sloth and torpor we are not merely standing still as to the development
of kusala, but we are “sinking”, we are going “downhill”, since there is
opportunity for the accumulation of more akusala. If we realize that the
opportunity to develop right understanding of the present moment is only
at the present moment, not at some moment in the future, there can be
conditions for mindfulness and then there is “wise attention” instead of
“unwise attention”.

Sloth and torpor can arise only with akusala cittas which are
“prompted”, *sasaṅkhārika.* Some types of cittas are “unprompted” or not
induced (asaṅkhārika) and some types are “prompted”, instigated or
induced. The inducement can be done by someone else or by oneself. The
cittas which are prompted are, according to the *Visuddhimagga* (XIV,
91) “sluggish and urged on”. Thus, sloth and torpor which are lazy and
sluggish with regard to the performing of kusala arise only with the
akusala cittas which are prompted [(130)](#FOOT130). They can arise with
the *four types of lobha-mūla-citta* which are *sasaṅkhārika* and with
*one type of dosa-mūla-citta*, the type which is *sasaṅkhārika*
[(131)](#FOOT131). This does not mean that they arise every time the
akusala citta is “prompted”; they may or may not arise with these five
types of akusala citta. The two types of moha-mūla-citta are not
“prompted”, they cannot be accompanied by sloth and torpor.

Sloth and torpor can arise together with *wrong view*, *diṭṭhi*, and in
this case they accompany lobha-mūla-citta which is associated with wrong
view and prompted. Sloth and torpor can arise together with conceit,
māna, and in this case they accompany lobha-mūla-citta which is without
wrong view and prompted [(132)](#FOOT132). Sloth and torpor which arise
with lobha-mūla-citta may be accompanied by pleasant feeling or by
indifferent feeling.

Sloth and torpor can arise together with envy (issā), stinginess
(macchariya) or regret (kukkucca) which, one at a time, can accompany
dosa-mūla-citta, and in that case the dosa-mūla-citta is prompted. The
accompanying feeling is unpleasant feeling.

Sloth and torpor are hard to eradicate. Even the sotāpanna, the
sakadāgāmī and the anāgāmī still have sloth and torpor. Only the arahat
has eradicated them completely. We are likely to have many moments of
sloth and torpor, but it is not easy to know when they occur. We should
remember that, when there are defilements such as wrong view, conceit,
envy, stinginess or regret, sloth and torpor can arise as well if the
citta they accompany is prompted. Sloth and torpor cause mental
unwieldiness and mental indisposition or sickness, so that there is no
vigour, no energy for kusala. Sloth and torpor are harmful, they are
among the “hindrances” which prevent us from performing dāna, observing
sīla or applying ourselves to mental development.

The Buddha told the monks to be moderate in eating and warned them not
to be attached to the “ease of bed”, because such attachments give rise
to sloth and torpor which are mental sickness and which destroy energy
for kusala. We read in the *Middle Length Sayings* (I, no. 16, Discourse
on Mental Barrenness) that the Buddha, when he was staying near
Sāvatthī, in the Jeta Grove, spoke about ways of mental barrenness and
mental bondages. One of the mental bondages is attachment to food and
sleep. We read that the Buddha said:

And again, monks, a monk having eaten as much as his belly will hold,
lives intent on the ease of bed, on the ease of lying down, on the ease
of slumber. Whatever monk, having eaten as much as his belly will hold,
lives intent on the ease of bed, on the ease of lying down, on the ease
of slumber, his mind does not incline to ardour, to continual
application, to perseverance, to striving…

It is helpful, not only for monks, but also for laymen, to be reminded
of conditions for laziness as to kusala.

We read in the *Gradual Sayings* (Book of the Fives, Chapter VI, par6,
The preceptor) about a monk who complained to his preceptor concerning
his lack of energy for kusala:

> Now a certain monk approached his preceptor and said:
>
> “My body, sir, is as it were drugged; the quarters are not seen by me;
> things [(133)](#FOOT133) are not clear to me; sloth and torpor compass
> my heart about and stay; joyless, I live the holy life; and doubt
> about things are ever with me.”

Such complaints may sound familiar to us, we may feel at times as though
“drugged”. Doubts about realities cannot be solved unless right
understanding is being developed. There are nāma and rūpa all the time,
there is seeing, visible object, hearing, sound, anger or attachment;
the objects of which right understanding is to be developed are right at
hand but often there is no awareness of them. We read that the preceptor
went with this monk to the Buddha who exhorted him thus:

> “Monk, it is ever thus! When one dwells with doors of the senses
> unguarded, with no moderation in eating, not bent on vigilance, not
> looking for righteous things, nor day in day out practise the practice
> of making become things that are wings to enlightenment; then is the
> body as though drugged, the quarters are not seen, things are not
> clear, sloth and torpor compass the heart and stay; joyless, one lives
> the divine life; and doubts about things are ever with one”.

We then read that the Buddha told that monk to guard the doors of the
senses, to be moderate in eating, to be vigilant and to cultivate the
factors leading to enlightenment. The monk followed the Buddha’s advice.
The Buddha’s words were the right condition for him to develop insight,
even to the degree that he could attain arahatship. Thus he was no
longer subject to sloth and torpor.

Sloth and torpor destruct energy for kusala. When there is right effort
there are no sloth and torpor. However, there is no self who can put
forth energy for kusala, for the study of the Dhamma or for the
development of right understanding. We can prove this when there is
listlessness and no energy for kusala. At such a moment we cannot force
ourselves to take an interest in kusala. Right effort is only a
conditioned dhamma, not self. There can be a long period of indolence,
but at times there can be conditions for remembering words of the
teachings which can encourage us to develop right understanding. Also
sad events which happen in life can serve as a reminder of the
impermanence of conditioned realities and then we may be urged to be
vigilant, to “guard the sense-doors”, that is, to be mindful of the
realities appearing through the different doorways. In this life we are
in the human plane where there is opportunity for all kinds of kusala,
for the study of the Dhamma and the development of right understanding.
The goal has been reached only when all defilements have been
eradicated, when arahatship has been attained. When we realize the task
which lies ahead of us we are reminded not to waste time with akusala.
When there is a true sense of urgency to develop right understanding
there will be less opportunity for sloth and torpor. In the following
sutta we are reminded of what we fail to win when there is indolence and
what can be won when there is right energy. We read in the *Kindred
Sayings* (II, Nidāna-vagga, Kindred Sayings on Cause, 3, par22) that the
Buddha encouraged the monks to apply energy in order to attain the goal.
He said:

> Sadly, monks, lives the man of sloth, involved in bad, wicked things.
> Great is the salvation which he fails to win. But he of stirred up
> energy lives happily, aloof from bad, wicked things. Great is the
> salvation that he makes perfect.


Vicikicchā
----------

Vicikicchā or doubt is another akusala cetasika and this can accompany
only one type of citta, namely the type of moha-mūla-citta which is
called: moha-mūla-citta vicikicchā sampayutta (rooted in ignorance,
accompanied by doubt).

The reality of vicikicchā is not the same as what we mean by doubt in
conventional language. Vicikicchā is not doubt about someone’s name or
about the weather. Vicikicchā is doubt about *realities*, about nāma and
rūpa, about cause and result, about the four noble Truths, about the
“Dependant Origination”.

The *Atthasālinī* (II, Part IX, Chapter III, 259) defines vicikicchā as
follows:

> …It has shifting about as characteristic, mental wavering as function,
> indecision or uncertainty in grasp as manifestation, unsystematic
> thought (unwise attention) as proximate cause, and it should be
> regarded as a danger to attainment.

The *Visuddhimagga* (XIV, 177) gives a similar definition.

When there is doubt one “wavers”, one is not sure about realities. The
*Dhammasangaṇi* (par425) describes doubt in different ways and states
among others that it is “uncertainty of grasp”, “stiffness of mind”. The
*Atthasālinī* (II, 259, 260) in its explanation of this paragraph of the
*Dhammasangaṇi* states:

> …“Fluctuation” is the inability to establish anything in one mode,
> thus, “Is this state permanent, or is it impermanent?” Because of the
> inability to “comprehend” there is “uncertainty of grasp”….

As to “stiffness”, the *Atthasālinī* remarks that “mental rigidity” is
the inability to come to a decision as to the object. We read:
“Stiffness is the meaning. For perplexity having arisen makes the mind
stiff….”

When there is doubt one wonders about realities: “Is it such or is it
such?” One wonders, for example, whether a reality is permanent or
impermanent, or whether the reality which appears now is nāma or rūpa.
When there is doubt there is mental rigidity, there is not the
wieldiness of mind which is necessary for the understanding of
realities. Doubt is to be considered as a “danger for attainment”; when
there is doubt it is impossible to apply oneself to mental development.

Doubt is different from ignorance, moha, which does not know realities.
But when there is doubt there is also moha which accompanies all akusala
dhammas. When doubt accompanies the akusala citta, there cannot be
determination (adhimokkha) which is “sure about the object”, neither can
there be “wish-to-do” (chanda) which “searches for the object” and wants
it [(134)](#FOOT134).

The proximate cause of doubt is “unwise attention” to the object which
is experienced at that moment. We read in the *Gradual Sayings* (Book of
the Ones, Chapter II, par5) that the Buddha said to the monks:

> Monks, I know not of any other single thing of such power to cause the
> arising of doubt and wavering, if not already arisen; or, if arisen,
> to cause its more-becoming and increase, as unsystematic attention.
>
> In him who gives not systematic attention arises doubt and wavering,
> if not already arisen; or, if arisen, it is liable to more-becoming
> and increase.

When one performs dāna, observes sīla, studies Dhamma or is mindful of
nāma and rūpa, there is no opportunity for doubt, because during such
moments there is “wise attention”.

We read in the *Middle Length Sayings* (I, no. 2, All the cankers) that
the Buddha, when he was near Sāvatthī, in the Jeta Grove, spoke to the
monks on the means of controlling all the cankers. He spoke about unwise
attention and about various kinds of doubt, pertaining to the past, the
future or the present, which may arise when there is no wise attention.
We read about doubt:

> In these ways he is not wisely attending: if he thinks, “Now, was I in
> a past period? Now, was I not in a past period? Now, what was I in a
> past period? Now, how was I in a past period? Now, having been what,
> what did I become in a past period?….

We read the same about doubt pertaining to the future and doubt
pertaining to the present.

When doubt is accumulated there can be doubt about many different
subjects. We read in the *Dhammasangaṇi* (par1004) that there can be
doubt about the Buddha, the Dhamma and the Sangha, the Discipline, the
past or the future or both, the “Dependant Origination”
[(135)](#FOOT135).

The *Atthasālinī* (II, Book II, Part II, Chapter I, 354, 355) explains
as to doubts about the Buddha, the Dhamma and the Sangha, that one may
doubt about the qualities of the Buddha or about the characteristic
marks of his body [(136)](#FOOT136), that one may doubt whether there is
attainment of enlightenment, whether there is nibbāna, or whether there
are people who can attain enlightenment. As to doubt about the past and
the future, this doubt can concern the “khandhas”, the “dhātus”
(elements) and “āyatanas” (twelve bases) in the past and in the future.

Do we have doubt about rebirth? One may not be sure whether it is true
that the last citta in this life will be succeeded by the first citta of
the next life. One may have theoretical understanding of the fact that
each citta which falls away is succeeded by a next one, but there may
still be moments of doubt. We may at times also doubt whether it is
possible to develop right understanding and whether this is the way
leading to enlightenment. Doubt can never be eradicated by thinking.
When we begin to develop understanding of nāma and rūpa there may be
doubt whether the reality appearing at the present moment is nāma or
rūpa. Their characteristics are quite different but we are confused
about them. There can only be less doubt if we continue to be mindful of
them when they appear one at a time. Only in this way can we learn, for
example, that hardness is different from the experience of hardness and
that visible object is different from the experience of visible object.
It is useful to know that doubt is akusala, that it is a hindrance to
the performing of dāna, the observance of sīla and to mental
development. However, doubt can be object of mindfulness; when there is
mindfulness of its characteristic right understanding can know it as it
is.

Those who are not ariyans have not realized the four noble Truths and
they may still have doubt about realities. The sotāpanna sees realities
as they are, he has eradicated doubt completely. We read in the suttas
that the sotāpanna has “crossed over doubt”. We read, for example, in
the *Middle Length Sayings* (II, no. 91, Brahmāyusutta) about Brahmāyu:

> …Having seen dhamma, attained dhamma, known dhamma, plunged into
> dhamma, having crossed over doubt, put away uncertainty and attained
> without another’s help to full confidence in the Teacher’s
> instruction…

The sotāpanna still has to continue to develop satipaṭṭhāna, but he is
sure to be eventually liberated from the cycle of birth and death. He is
full of confidence in the Buddha, the Dhamma and the Sangha. His
confidence is unshakable and thus he has no more doubts about the
Buddha, the Dhamma and the Sangha. Those who have not attained
enlightenment need to listen often to the Dhamma and to be reminded to
be aware of realities in order to eradicate doubt.

It is useful to study the different types of akusala citta and their
accompanying cetasikas [(137)](#FOOT137). The study will help us to see
that akusala dhammas arise because of their appropriate conditions, that
citta and cetasikas which arise together condition one another. We are
reminded by the study of realities that akusala dhamma is not a person,
that it does not belong to a self. However, we should not be contented
with merely theoretical knowledge of the truth. We should continue to
develop right understanding of realities which appear through the six
doors. Akusala dhammas cannot be eradicated immediately. We should first
learn to see them as they are: as conditioned nāmas, not self. Through
right understanding of realities doubt, wrong view and all the other
akusala dhammas can be eradicated.
