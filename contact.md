Contact (phassa)
----------------

A citta cannot arise alone, it has to be accompanied by cetasikas. When
there is seeing citta cognizes visible object and the cetasikas which
accompany the citta also experience visible object. The citta is the
“leader”, while the cetasikas which share the same object perform each
their own task. The cetasikas have each their own characteristic
(lakkhaṇaṃ: specific or generic attribute), function (rasa: function or
achievement), manifestation (paccupaṭṭhāna: manifestation, appearance or
effect) and proximate cause (padaṭṭhānaṃ)[(4)](#FOOT4). There are many
conditions for the different phenomena which appear, but the “proximate
cause” or immediate occasion is mentioned in particular when the
cetasikas are defined in the commentaries, the *Atthasālinī* (Expositor)
and the *Visuddhimagga*. There are seven cetasikas which have to arise
with every citta; they are called the “universals”
(sabbacitta-sādhāranā). Some cittas are accompanied only by the
universals, others are accompanied by several more cetasikas in
addition. Thus, every citta is accompanied by at least the seven
universals.

The universals arise with every citta and thus they arise with all the
cittas of the four jātis: with akusala citta, kusala citta, vipākacitta
and kiriyacitta. They arise with all cittas in all planes of existence
where there is nāma: with the cittas of the woeful planes, in the human
being plane, in the deva planes, in the rūpa-brahma planes, except the
asaññā-satta plane (the plane where there is only rūpa not
nāma)[(5)](#FOOT5) and in the arūpa-brahma planes. They arise with all
cittas of all planes of consciousness: with kāmāvacara-cittas (sensuous
plane of citta), with rūpāvacara cittas (plane of rūpa-jhānacittas),
arūpāvacara cittas (plane of arūpa-jhānacittas) and with lokuttara
cittas (cittas which experience nibbāna)[(6)](#FOOT6).

Contact, in Pāli: phassa, is mentioned first among the universals.
Phassa arises together with every citta; it “contacts” the object so
that citta can experience it. When seeing experiences visible object,
phassa which accompanies seeing-consciousness also experiences visible
object but it performs its own function. At that moment phassa
“contacts” visible object and conditions seeing-consciousness to see.

The *Atthasālinī* (Expositor, Part IV, Chapter I, 108) states about
contact:

> Contact means “it touches”. It has touching as its salient
> characteristic, impact as its function, “coinciding” (of the physical
> base, object and consciousness) as its manifestation, and the object
> which has entered the avenue (of awareness) as proximate
> cause[(7)](#FOOT7).

The *Visuddhimagga* (Path of Purification XIV, 134) gives a similar
definition.

Phassa is different from what we mean in conventional language by
physical contact or touch. When we use the word contact in conventional
language we may think of the impingement of something external on one of
the senses, for example the impingement of hardness on the bodysense. We
may use words such as touching or impingement in order to describe
phassa, but we should not forget that phassa is nāma, a cetasika which
arises together with the citta and assists the citta so that it can
experience the object which presents itself through the appropriate
doorway. When hardness presents itself through the bodysense there is
phassa, contact, arising together with the citta which experiences the
hardness. Phassa is not the mere collision of hardness with the
bodysense, it is not touch in the physical sense. Impact is the function
of phassa in the sense that it assists the citta so that it can cognize
the object.

Phassa is manifested by coinciding or concurrence, namely, by the
coinciding of three factors: physical base (vatthu), object and
consciousness.

When there is seeing, there is the coinciding of eye (the eyebase),
visible object and seeing-consciousness; through this concurrence
phassa, which is in this case eye-contact, is manifested.

We read in the ’Discourse of the Honey-ball’ (Middle Length Sayings I,
no. 18) that Mahā-Kaccāna explained to the monks concerning contact:

> This situation occurs: that when there is eye, your reverences, when
> there is visible object, when there is visual consciousness, one will
> recognise the manifestation of sensory impingement (phassa)...

When there is the concurrence of the ear, sound and
hearing-consciousness, there is the manifestation of ear-contact. When
there is the concurrence of body-sense, a tangible object such as
hardness and the experience of hardness, there is the manifestation of
body-contact. Eye-contact is different from ear-contact and different
from body-contact. At each moment of citta there is a different phassa
which conditions the citta to experience an object.

Phassa is not the doorway through which citta experiences an object. In
the case of a sense-door process the rūpa which is one of the senses is
doorway and in the case of a mind-door process nāma is doorway, namely
the last bhavanga-citta arising before the mind-door
adverting-consciousness, the first citta of the mind-door
process[(8)](#FOOT8).

In the planes of existence where there are nāma and rūpa, cittas have a
physical base or place of origin, the vatthu[(9)](#FOOT9). The vatthu is
rūpa. In the case of the ’pañca-viññāṇas’ (seeing, hearing, etc.) the
vatthus are the ’pasāda-rūpas’ (the rūpas which are capable of receiving
visible object, sound, etc.). In the case of the pañca-viññāṇas the
pasāda-rūpa functions as both vatthu and doorway, ’dvāra’. For example,
the rūpa which is eyesense (cakkhuppasāda-rūpa) is both doorway and
vatthu for seeing-consciousness. Although it is one and the same rūpa,
the functions of dvāra and vatthu are different. The dvāra is the means
through which citta experiences an object, and the vatthu is the
physical base for the citta. Only for the pañca-viññāṇas are the dvāra
and the vatthu one and the same rūpa. For the other cittas of the
sense-door process the dvāra and the vatthu are different rūpas; they
have as their vatthu another kind of rūpa which is in the commentaries
called the ’heart-base’ (hadaya-vatthu)[(10)](#FOOT10). The cittas which
arise in the mind-door process also have as their vatthu the
’heart-base’. The vatthu is the physical base not only of citta, but
also of the cetasikas which accompany the citta. When
seeing-consciousness arises at the eye-base (cakkhu-vatthu), phassa and
the other cetasikas which accompany seeing-consciousness arise also at
the eye-base. Thus, citta and the accompanying cetasikas arise together
at the same vatthu; they share the same object and they fall away
together.

The different cittas with their accompanying cetasikas arise when there
are the appropriate conditions for their arising. Even when our eyes are
open, there is not seeing all the time. There are many different types
of cittas which arise one at a time. When there is, for example, hearing
or thinking there cannot be seeing at the same time. When there are the
appropriate conditions for seeing-consciousness, it arises. Then there
is the concurrence of the eye, visible object and seeing. Eye-contact
performs its function so that seeing can experience visible object.

Contact ’supports’ the citta and the other cetasikas which accompany the
citta. There must be contact arising with the citta in order that it can
cognize its object. Contact also supports the other cetasikas it arises
together with: without contact there could not be feeling, perception
(saññā) or volition (cetanā). The *Atthasālinī* (108) compares phassa
with a pillar in a palace which is a strong support to the rest of the
structure. In the same way contact is a strong support to the citta and
the accompanying cetasikas.

Is there contact now? There is the experience of an object right now and
thus there has to be contact as well. There are seeing, hearing or
thinking occurring time and again. We think that it is ’I’ who sees,
hears or thinks, but in reality there are different cittas conditioned
by different factors. Knowing more about the different factors through
which realities are conditioned will help us to understand that there is
no self who experiences an object. Seeing is a nāma which arises because
of the concurrence of different factors and it cannot stay, it has to
fall away again. We cannot force it to arise nor can we force it to
stay.

When we are busy with our work, there are different realities presenting
themselves through the senses, but we are usually forgetful of them.
When hardness presents itself, phassa performs its function so that
citta can experience the object. There is no self who experiences
hardness. Considering realities can condition the arising of
mindfulness, no matter whether we walk, stand, sit or lie down.

When we study cetasikas we should not forget that cetasikas never arise
alone; they have to arise together with citta. They arise with the
cittas of our daily life, they are not abstract categories. Since citta
and cetasikas which arise together condition one another, the cetasikas
and thus also phassa have different qualities when they arise with
different types of citta. Phassa which arises with akusala citta is also
akusala; phassa which arises with kusala citta is also kusala. When
phassa arises with lokuttara citta phassa is also lokuttara: at that
moment it ’contacts’ nibbāna, the object of the lokuttara citta.

Phassa accompanies each of the cittas which arise in different
processes: in the sense-door processes and in the mind-door
processes[(11)](#FOOT11). Phassa also accompanies the cittas which do
not arise in a process of cittas[(12)](#FOOT12), it accompanies the
paṭisandhi-citta (rebirth-consciousness) the bhavanga-citta
(life-continuum)[(13)](#FOOT13) and the cuti-citta
(dying-consciousness). Although these cittas do not arise in a process,
they experience an object: the same object as experienced by the last
javana cittas arising before the cuti-citta of the previous
life[(14)](#FOOT14). Phassa which accompanies these cittas contacts that
object.

When there is seeing, visible object is experienced through the eyesense
and at that moment there is *eye-contact* (cakkhu-samphassa). Phassa is
eye-contact only at the moment of seeing-consciousness[(15)](#FOOT15).
The phassa accompanying hearing-consciousness (sota-viññāṇa) is
*ear-contact* (sota-samphassa). The phassas arising with the five
sense-cognitions (pañcaviññāṇa) are named after the relevant
sense-base[(16)](#FOOT16).

When the cittas of the sense-door process have fallen away, the object
is experienced through the mind-door. When the
mind-door-adverting-consciousness (mano-dvārāvajjana-citta) adverts to
the object through the mind-door the phassa accompanying the
mano-dvārāvajjana-citta contacts that object. The
mano-dvārāvajjana-citta is succeeded by the javana-cittas which
experience the same object and the phassas accompanying the
javana-cittas contact that object.

The javana-cittas are, in the case of the non-arahat, either akusala
cittas or kusala cittas. Most of the time the javana-cittas are akusala
cittas; since we have accumulated many kinds of defilements akusala
cittas are bound to arise. When we, for example, see a pleasant object,
we are likely to be attached to it and to have pleasant feeling on
account of the object. However, attachment does not arise at the moment
of seeing-consciousness. Seeing-consciousness is vipākacitta (citta
which is result) and it is invariably accompanied by indifferent
feeling. The phassa which accompanies the seeing-consciousness is also
vipāka. When we like what we see there are javana-cittas which are
lobha-mūla-cittas (cittas rooted in attachment) and these may be
accompanied by pleasant feeling or by indifferent feeling. The phassa
which accompanies akusala citta is also akusala. The phassas which
accompany different kinds of citta are different and the feelings which
accompany the cittas are different as well. The following sutta in the
*Kindred Sayings* (IV, Saḷāyatana-vagga, Kindred Sayings on Sense, Third
Fifty, Chapter III, par 129, Ghosita) deals with realities as elements
and it is explained that different phenomena which arise have different
conditions. The sutta does not mention each moment of citta in the
process of cittas. It is understood that the pleasant feeling and
unpleasant feeling referred to do not arise at the moment of
seeing-consciousness, but later on in the process. We read:

> Once the venerable Ānanda was staying at Kosambī in Ghosita Park.
>
> Then the housefather Ghosita came to see the venerable Ānanda. Seated
> at one side he said this to the venerable Ānanda:
>
> ’“Diversity in elements! Diversity in elements!” is the saying, my
> lord Ānanda. Pray, sir, how far has diversity in elements been spoken
> of by the Exalted One?’
>
> ’When the elements of eye and objects that are pleasing and
> eye-consciousness occur together, housefather, owing to the
> pleasurable contact there arises pleasant feeling. When the elements
> of eye, objects that are displeasing and eye-consciousness occur
> together, owing to the unpleasant contact resulting there arises
> painful feeling. When the elements of eye, objects that are of
> indifferent effect and eye-consciousness occur together, owing to
> neutral contact resulting, there arises feeling that is neutral.
>
> So when the elements of ear…nose…tongue… body…when the elements of
> mind and objects that are pleasurable and mindconsciousness occur
> together.
>
> When mind and objects that are displeasing…or mind and objects that
> are of indifferent effect occur together, owing to the contact
> resulting, whether it be pleasing, displeasing or neutral, there
> arises feeling that is pleasing, displeasing or neutral.
>
> Thus far, housefather, diversity in elements has been spoken of by the
> Exalted One.

When we read this sutta we can be reminded to see phenomena as elements
which arise dependent on conditions. Sometimes the object which phassa
contacts is pleasant, sometimes unpleasant; this is beyond control.
Because of our defilements, attachment, aversion and ignorance arise
time and again. If we learn to see the events of our life as conditioned
elements, right understanding will develop.

We have different contacts through the eyes and through the ears. When
we are at the opera, we may dislike the sight of someone who is singing
but we may like the sound. There are different objects and different
contacts; there can be like and dislike at different moments. In reality
there is no singer nor is there a person who can look at him and listen
to his singing at the same time. There are only different elements,
nāmas and rūpas, which each have their appropriate conditions for their
arising and can only be experienced *one at a time.*

The citta and the accompanying cetasikas which experience visible object
arise at one moment; the citta and the accompanying cetasikas which
experience sound arise at another moment, in another process of cittas.
The dislike of visible object cannot arise at the same time as the
attachment to the sound; they arise in different processes of cittas.
Cittas succeed one another very rapidly and at each moment there is a
different contact accompanying the citta. Because of ignorance we do not
know the reality which is experienced at the present moment. We do not
know whether it is sound, visible object or a concept. We think that all
these realities can appear at the same time. We think most of the time
of concepts instead of being aware of realities as they appear one at a
time.

The study of phassa cetasika can remind us that at each moment a
different citta arises, dependant on different conditions. When there is
seeing phassa cannot contact any other object but visible object. Seeing
can experience only visible object; it cannot experience a person in the
visible object. When there is hearing, phassa cannot contact any other
object but sound. Hearing cannot experience a person in the sound. When
there is thinking of a concept there is a different citta with a
different phassa which contacts the object citta is thinking of. There
cannot be more than one contact at a time.

A detailed knowledge of different cittas and their accompanying
cetasikas will help us to understand the realities of our daily life as
they appear one at a time. It is important to have more understanding of
realities such as seeing or hearing. They are cittas arising time and
again in daily life. They experience pleasant or unpleasant objects and
on account of these objects kusala cittas or akusala cittas arise, but
mostly akusala cittas. Through the Abhidhamma we acquire a more precise
knowledge of realities, but the knowledge should not stay at the level
of theory. When we study the Abhidhamma we can be reminded to be aware
of whatever reality appears at the present moment, and in this way the
study will lead us to realize fully the aim of the Buddha’s teachings:
right understanding of realities.
