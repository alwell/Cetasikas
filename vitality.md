Vitality (jīvitindriya)
-----------------------

Jīvitindriya (life-faculty or vitality) and *manasikāra* (attention) are
two other cetasikas among the seven universals which arise with every
citta. As regards *jīvitindriya*,[(47)](#FOOT47) this cetasika sustains
the life of the citta and cetasikas it accompanies. According to the
*Atthasālinī* (part IV, Chapter I, 123, 124)[(48)](#FOOT48) the
characteristic of jīvitindriya is “ceaseless watching”, its function is
to maintain the life of the accompanying dhammas, its manifestation the
establishment of them, and the proximate cause are the dhammas which
have to be sustained.

The function of jīvitindriya is to maintain the life of citta and its
accompanying cetasikas. It keeps them going until they fall away. Since
jīvitindriya arises and falls away together with the citta, it performs
its function only for a very short while. Each moment of citta consists
actually of three extremely short periods:

-   the arising moment (uppāda khaṇa)
-   the moment of its presence, or static moment (tiṭṭhi khaṇa)
-   the dissolution moment (bhaṅga khaṇa)

Jīvitindriya arises with the citta at the arising moment and it
maintains the life of citta and the accompanying cetasikas, but it
cannot make them stay beyond the dissolution moment; then jīvitindriya
has to fall away together with the citta and the accompanying cetasikas.

The Atthasālinī states concerning jīvitindriya:

> …it watches over those states (the accompanying dhammas) only in the
> moment of (their and its) existence, as water over lotuses, etc. And
> although it watches over them, arisen as its own property, as a nurse
> over the infant, life goes on only by being bound up with these states
> ( accompanying dhammas) that have gone on, as the pilot on the boat.
> Beyond the dissolution moment it does not go on, owing to the
> non-being both of itself and of the states which should have been kept
> going. At the dissolution moment it does not maintain them, owing to
> its own destruction, as the spent oil in the wick cannot maintain the
> flame of the lamp. Its effective power is as its duration.

Citta and cetasikas cannot arise without jīvitindriya which maintains
their lives and jīvitindriya cannot arise without citta and the
accompanying cetasikas. When, for example, seeing arises, jīvitindriya
must accompany seeing. Seeing needs jīvitindriya in order to subsist
during the very short period of its life. When seeing falls away
jīvitindriya also falls away. Then another citta arises and this citta
is accompanied by another jīvitindriya which sustains citta and the
accompanying cetasikas during that very short moment of their existence.
Jīvitindriya has to arise with every citta in order to vitalize citta
and its accompanying cetasikas.

The cetasika jīvitindriya which vitalizes the accompanying nāma-dhammas
is nāma. There is also jīvitindriya which is rūpa.[(49)](#FOOT49)
Rūpa-jīvitindriya is a kind of rūpa produced by kamma and it maintains
the life of the other rūpas it arises together with. Rūpas of the body
arise and fall away in groups, some of which are produced by kamma, some
by citta, some by nutrition and some by temperature. Jīvitindriya is
part only of the groups or rūpa which are produced by kamma. It
maintains the life of the rūpas it accompanies and then it falls away
together with them.

We used to take life for something which lasts. We cling to life and we
take it for ’mine’ and ’self’. However, there is no physical life nor
mental life which lasts. Life-faculty is saṅkhāra dhamma, conditioned
dhamma, which does not stay and which is not self. The study of the
reality of jīvitindriya can remind us that life lasts only for a moment
and then falls away to be succeeded by a next moment.

Attention (manasikāra)
--------------------------

Manasikāra, attention, is another cetasika among the universals which
arises with every citta.[(50)](#FOOT50) The *Atthasālinī* (I, Part IV,
Chapter 1, 133) which defines manasikāra in the same wording as the
*Visuddhimagga* (XIV, 152) states concerning the cetasika which is
manasikāra:

> …It has the characteristic of driving associated states towards the
> object, the function of joining (yoking) associated states to the
> object, the manifestation of facing the object. It is included in the
> saṅkhārakkhandha, and should be regarded as the charioteer of
> associated states because it regulates the object.

The *Visuddhimagga* (XIV, 152) adds that the proximate cause of
manasikāra is an object.

The cetasika manasikāra which can be translated as attention is the
’controller of the object’ because it turns the citta towards the
object. However, also at the moments we are, as we call it in
conventional language, ’distracted’ and we think that we are without
attention, there is still manasikāra with the citta since it accompanies
every citta. Also when there is moha-mūla-citta accompanied by uddhacca
(restlessness), citta cognizes an object; manasikāra accompanies the
citta and ’joins’ citta and the other cetasikas to that object. Every
citta needs manasikāra in order to cognize an object.

There is citta at this moment and thus there must also be manasikāra.
Manasikāra is different from phassa which contacts the object so that
citta can experience it, and it is different from ekaggatā cetasika
which focuses on one object. Manasikāra has its own task while it
assists the citta in cognizing the object. Manasikāra has attention to
whatever object presents itself through one of the six doors and it
’joins’ citta and the accompanying cetasikas to that object.

Manasikāra is different according as it arises with different types of
citta. When, for example, seeing arises, it is accompanied by manasikāra
which joins seeing and the accompanying cetasikas to visible object.
Seeing is vipāka and thus manasikāra is also vipāka. Shortly after the
seeing there can be attention to the shape and form of something and
then the object is not visible object but a concept. At that moment
there is another type of citta accompanied by another manasikāra. At
each moment manasikāra is different. When there is lobha-mūla-citta,
akusala citta rooted in attachment, manasikāra which accompanies
lobha-mūla-citta is also akusala. When there is kusala citta the
manasikāra which accompanies the kusala citta is also kusala.

When manasikāra accompanies a citta which cultivates samatha, it ’joins’
citta and the other cetasikas to the meditation subject, such as a
corpse or the Buddha’s virtues. When the citta is rūpāvacara kusala
citta, the accompanying manasikāra is also rūpāvacara; it is different
from manasikāra which is kāmāvacara (belonging to the sense sphere).
Rūpāvacara citta experiences the meditation subject with absorption and
the accompanying manasikāra ’joins’ citta and the accompanying cetasikas
to that object. The manasikāra which accompanies arūpāvacara citta is
still more tranquil and more refined than the manasikāra which
accompanies rūpāvacara citta. When manasikāra accompanies the citta
which develops vipassanā, right understanding of nāma and rūpa, there is
attention towards the nāma or rūpa which is the object of mindfulness at
that moment; manasikāra assists the citta and joins it to that nāma or
rūpa. When manasikāra accompanies lokuttara citta, manasikāra is also
lokuttara and it joins citta and the accompanying cetasikas to the
object which is nibbāna.

We are likely to have a concept of self which has attention to this or
that object, but attention, manasikāra, is a *conditioned dhamma,* it is
conditioned by the citta and the cetasikas it accompanies, it arises and
falls away together with them. At each moment there is a different citta
and thus also a different manasikāra.

The *seven universals* have each their own specific characteristic,
function, manifestation and proximate cause and they have different
qualities as they arise with cittas of different jātis and of different
planes of consciousness. Summarizing the seven ’universals’, they are:

-   phassa (contact)
-   vedanā (feeling)
-   saññā (remembrance)
-   cetanā (volition)
-   ekaggatā ( concentration or one-pointedness)
-   jīvitindriya (life faculty)
-   manasikāra (attention)

All the ’universals’ arise with every citta and they share the same
object with the citta. They are all of the same jāti as the citta they
accompany and of the same plane of consciousness. In the planes of
existence where there are both nāma and rūpa, cetasikas arise at the
same ’base’, vatthu, as the citta they accompany and thus, they may
arise at the eye-base, ear-base nose-base, tongue-base, body-base or
heart-base.

Cetasikas never arise by themselves, they always accompany citta and
other cetasikas. Therefore, when we study cetasikas, we should also
study the different cittas they accompany.

There are other cetasikas besides the ’universals’ which can arise with
the citta, but there have to be at least the seven ’universals’ with
every citta.

There are ten types of cittas which are accompanied only by the
’universals’, not by other cetasikas. These are the ’five pairs’
(dvi-pañcaviññāṇa) which are: seeing-consciousness,
hearing-consciousness, smelling-consciousness, tasting-consciousness and
body-consciousness. These cittas are ahetuka (rootless) vipākacittas
which can be either kusala vipāka or akusala vipāka and therefore, they
are “five pairs”.

When seeing-consciousness arises, each of the ’universals’ which
accompanies it performs its own function. Phassa which accompanies
seeing-consciousness is eye-contact (cakkhu-samphassa). It contacts
visible object. When there is eye-contact there is the coinciding of
eye-base, visible object and seeing-consciousness. Vedanā, which is in
this case indifferent feeling, experiences the ’taste’ of visible
object. Saññā ’marks’ and remembers visible object. Cetanā coordinates
the tasks of the accompanying dhammas. Since seeing-consciousness is
vipākacitta, cetanā merely coordinates, it does not ’will’ kusala or
akusala. Ekaggatā performs its function of focusing on visible object;
it does not focus on any other object. Jīvitindriya sustains citta and
the accompanying cetasikas until they fall away. Manasikāra ’drives’
citta and the accompanying cetasikas towards visible object.
Seeing-consciousness needs the accompanying ’universals’ in order to
cognize visible object; it could not arise and cognize its object
without the assistance of the accompanying cetasikas.

As we have seen, only the dvi-pañcaviññāṇas (the five pairs of
sense-cognitions) are not accompanied by other cetasikas besides the
’universals’. All the other cittas which arise in the sense-door process
and in the mind-door process and also the paṭisandhi-citta,
rebirth-consciousness, the bhavanga-citta, life-continuum, and the
cuti-citta, dying-consciousness, are accompanied by other cetasikas
besides the ’universals’.

The ’universals’ have different qualities as they arise with different
cittas. For example, when kusala citta arises all the accompanying
cetasikas, the ’universals’ included, are kusala as well. Vedanā,
feeling, which accompanies kusala citta can be pleasant feeling or
indifferent feeling. Cetanā, volition, which accompanies kusala citta
has a double function: it coordinates the tasks of the accompanying
dhammas and it ’wills’ kusala. If it motivates wholesome deeds it is
capable of producing the appropriate result when it is the right time
for it. Thus, kusala cetanā is different from cetanā which accompanies
vipākacitta.

When the citta is akusala, all the accompanying cetasikas are akusala as
well. Vedanā which accompanies akusala citta can be pleasant feeling (in
the case of lobha-mūla-citta), unpleasant feeling (in the case of
dosa-mūla-citta), or indifferent feeling (in the case of
lobha-mūla-citta and moha-mūla-citta). As regards cetanā which
accompanies akusala citta, this has a double function: it coordinates
the accompanying dhammas on the object and it ’wills’ akusala. If it
motivates unwholesome deeds it is capable of producing the appropriate
result when it is the right time. Ekaggatā, concentration or
one-pointedness, which accompanies akusala citta is different from
ekaggatā which accompanies kusala citta. Thus we see that mental
phenomena which arise together condition one another. If we have more
understanding of the many different conditions for the phenomena which
arise, it will help us to see them as elements, not as a person, a self.

### Questions

1.  Does manasikāra, attention, arise when we are sound asleep?

5.  Each of the ’universals’ has its specific characteristic, function,
    manifestation and proximate cause. Why can each one of them still
    have different qualities at different moments?
6.  Through how many doors can the ’universals’ experience an object?
7.  Can the ’universals’ experience a concept?
8.  When the citta is akusala citta, it is accompanied by akusala
    cetasikas. Are the accompanying ’universals’ akusala as well?
