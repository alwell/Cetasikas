Volition (cetanā)
-----------------

Cetanā, volition, is another cetasika among the ’universals’, the seven
cetasikas which accompany every citta. Cetanā is often translated as
’volition’, but we should not be misled by the conventional term which
designates the reality of cetanā. Cetanā accompanies, together with
phassa (contact), vedanā (feeling), saññā (remembrance) and the other
’universals’, all cittas of the four jātis. Thus, cetanā accompanies
kusala citta, akusala citta, vipākacitta and kiriyacitta. When we intend
to steal or when we make the resolution not to kill, it is evident that
there is cetanā. However, also when we are seeing or hearing, and even
when we are asleep, there is cetanā since it accompanies every citta.
There is no citta without cetanā.

The *Atthasālinī* (I, Part IV, Chapter I, 111) states about cetanā that
its characteristic is coordinating the associated dhammas (citta and the
other cetasikas) on the object and that its function is ’willing’. We
read:

> …There is no such thing as volition in the four planes (of citta)
> without the characteristic of coordinating; all volition has it. But
> the function of ’willing’ is only in moral (kusala) and immoral
> (akusala) states…It has directing as manifestation. It arises
> directing associated states, like the chief disciple, the chief
> carpenter, etc. who fulfil their own and others’ duties.

The *Visuddhimagga* (XIV, 135) gives a similar
definition[(33)](#FOOT33). The characteristic of cetanā is coordinating.
It coordinates the citta and the other cetasikas it accompanies on the
object. Citta cognizes the object, it is the leader in knowing the
object. The cetasikas which accompany citta share the same object, but
they each have to fulfil their own task. For example, phassa contacts
the object, vedanā feels, experiences the “taste” of the object, and
saññā “marks” and remembers the object. Cetanā sees to it that the other
dhammas it arises together with fulfil their tasks with regard to the
object they all share. Every cetanā which arises, no matter whether it accompanies
kusala citta, akusala citta, vipākacitta or kiriyacitta, has to
coordinate the tasks of the other dhammas it accompanies. The
*Atthasālinī* compares cetanā with the chief disciple who recites
his own lessons and makes the other pupils recite their lessons as
well, with the chief carpenter who does his own work and makes the
other carpenters do their work, or with the general who fights himself
and makes the other soldiers take part in the battle, "...for
when he begins, the others follow his example. Even so, when volition
starts work on its object, it sets associated states to do each its
own."

The cetanā which accompanies kusala citta and akusala citta can be of the intensity to motivate wholesome and unwholesome deeds which produce their results accordingly. 
Kamma is actually cetanā cetasika. The cetanā which arises with each citta, with kusala citta, akusala citta, vipākacitta and kiriyacitta, and which coordinates the tasks of the accompanying dhammas, is conascent kamma-condition, sahajāta kamma-paccaya. The kusala cetanā and akusala cetanā that have the intensity of kusala kamma and akusala kamma that produce results are asynchronous kamma-paccaya, or kamma working from a different time, nāṇakkhaṇika kamma-paccaya.    
When we speak about kusala kamma or akusala kamma we usually think of *courses of action* (kamma pathas)
which can be performed through body, speech or mind. However, we should
remember that when we perform wholesome or unwholesome deeds it is
actually the wholesome or unwholesome *volition or intention* which
motivates the deed and this is the activity of kamma which is
accumulated and can produce its appropriate result later on. Thus,
*akusala kamma and kusala kamma are actually akusala cetanā and kusala
cetanā.*

Akusala cetanā and kusala cetanā can have many intensities, they can be
coarse or more subtle. When they are more subtle they do not motivate
kamma pathas, courses of action, through body, speech or mind. For
example, when we like our food there is lobha-mūla-citta and it is
accompanied by akusala cetanā. Although the lobha-mūla-citta does not
motivate an unwholesome course of action, it is not kusala but akusala;
it is different from kusala citta with generosity, from kusala citta
which observes sīla or from kusala citta which applies itself to mental
development. Whenever we do not apply ourselves to dāna, sīla or
bhāvanā, we act, speak or think with akusala cittas. Thus, there is
likely to be akusala citta very often in a day, since the moments we
apply ourselves to kusala are very rare. There is likely to be akusala
citta when we take hold of objects, eat, drink or talk. When we laugh
there is lobha-mūla citta. We may not realize that there is akusala
citta when the degree of akusala does not have the intensity of harming
others, but in fact there are countless moments of akusala citta.

When we are lying or slandering the degree of akusala is more coarse and
at such moments akusala cetanā motivates akusala kamma patha (course of
action) through speech. The akusala cetanā directs the other dhammas it
accompanies so that they perform their own tasks and it ’wills’ akusala.
Moreover, it is able to produce the appropriate result of the bad deed
later on, since the unwholesome volition or kamma is accumulated. Each
citta which arises falls away but it conditions the succeeding citta.
Since our life is an uninterrupted series of cittas which succeed one
another, unwholesome and wholesome volitions or kammas are accumulated
from moment to moment and can therefore produce results later on.

There are ten kinds of akusala kamma patha, courses of action, which are
performed through body, speech or mind[(35)](#FOOT35). They are:
killing, stealing, sexual misbehaviour, lying, slandering, rude speech,
frivolous talk, covetousness, ill-will and wrong view. The akusala
cetanā (or akusala kamma) which motivates such a deed is capable of
producing akusala vipāka in the form of rebirth in an unhappy plane of
existence or it can produce akusala vipāka which arises in the course of
one’s life, vipākacittas which experience unpleasant objects through the
senses.

Kamma patha can be of different degrees and thus its result is of
different degrees. Kamma patha is not always a ’completed action’. There
are certain constituent factors which make kamma patha a completed
action and for each of the kamma pathas these factors are different. For
example, in the case of killing there have to be: a living being,
consciousness that there is a living being, intention of killing, the
effort of killing and consequent death (*Atthasālinī*, I, Part III,
Chapter V, 97). When a large animal is killed the degree of akusala
kamma is higher than when a small animal is killed. The killing of a
human being is akusala kamma which is of a higher degree than the
killing of an animal.

In the case of slandering, there are four factors which make it a
completed action: other persons to be divided; the purpose: ’they will
be separated’, or the desire to endear oneself to another; the
corresponding effort; the communication (*Atthasālinī*, same section,
100 ). We read:

> “But when there is no rupture among others, the offence does not
> amount to a complete course; it does so only when there is a rupture.”

Akusala kamma patha which is a “completed action” is capable of
producing an unhappy rebirth. Some akusala kammas which are very
powerful such as killing a parent produce an unhappy rebirth in the
immediately following life. Some akusala kammas produce results in this
life, some in following lives. There are many intensities of akusala
kamma and they produce their results accordingly.

We read in the *Gradual Sayings* (Book of the Eights, Chapter IV, par10,
Very trifling) about different results which are produced by akusala
kammas. The ’very trifling result’ which is mentioned in the sutta is
the unpleasant result which arises in the course of one’s life. We read:

> Monks, taking life, when pursued, practised, increased, brings one to
> hell, to an animal’s womb, to the Peta realm[(36)](#FOOT36); what is
> the very trifling result of taking life is the shortening of a man’s
> life.
>
> Monks, stealing, when pursued…, brings one to hell…; the very trifling
> result is a man’s loss of wealth.
>
> Monks, fleshly lusts when pursued…, bring one to hell…; the very
> trifling result is a man’s rivalry and hatred.
>
> Monks, lying when pursued…, brings one to hell…; the very trifling
> result is the slandering and false-speaking for a man.
>
> Monks, backbiting, when pursued…, brings one to hell…; the very
> trifling result is the breaking up of a man’s friendships.
>
> Monks, harsh speech, when pursued…, brings one to hell…; the very
> trifling result is an unpleasant noise for a man.
>
> Monks, frivolous talk, when pursued…, brings one to hell… ; the very
> trifling result is unacceptable speech for a man.
>
> Monks, drinking strong drink, when pursued, practised, increased,
> brings one to hell, to an animal’s womb, to the Peta realm; what is
> the very trifling result of drinking strong drink is madness for a
> man.

When kusala kamma patha is performed, kusala cetanā “wills” kusala, and
it also coordinates the tasks of the other dhammas it accompanies.
Kusala cetanā is capable of producing its appropriate result later on in
the form of rebirth in a happy plane or it can produce its result in the
course of life in the form of pleasant experiences through the senses.

Kusala kamma can be classified as dāna (generosity), sīla (morality or
virtue) and bhāvanā (mental development). Dāna comprises, apart from
giving gifts, many other forms of kusala. Included in dāna are, for
example, appreciating the kusala cittas of others and ’sharing one’s
merits’. As to the sharing of one’s merits, when someone has done a
wholesome deed and he gives others the opportunity to rejoice in the
kusala he has performed, it is a way of dāna; at such a moment he helps
others to have kusala cittas as well. The observance of the precepts
which is sīla, can also be considered as a way of dāna. We read in the
*Gradual Sayings*, (Book of the Eights, Chapter IV, par9, Outcomes of
Merit) that going for refuge to the Buddha, the Dhamma and the Sangha
leads to happy results and that there are further five gifts which lead
to happy results. These are the following[(37)](#FOOT37):

> Herein, monks, a noble disciple gives up the taking of life and
> abstains from it. By abstaining from the taking of life, the noble
> disciple gives to immeasurable beings freedom from fear, gives to them
> freedom from hostility, and freedom from oppression. By giving to
> immeasurable beings freedom from fear, hostility and oppression, he
> himself will enjoy immeasurable freedom from fear, hostility and
> oppression…
>
> Further, monks, a noble disciple gives up the taking of what is not
> given… …gives up sexual misconduct... …gives up wrong speech... …gives
> up intoxicating drinks and drugs causing heedlessness, and abstains
> from them. By abstaining from intoxicating drinks and drugs, the noble
> disciple gives to immeasurable beings freedom from fear, freedom from
> hostility and freedom from oppression. By giving to immeasurable
> beings freedom from fear, hostility and oppression, he himself will
> enjoy immeasurable freedom from fear, freedom from hostility and
> freedom from oppression…

When we abstain from ill deeds we give others the opportunity to live in
safety and without fear.

Sīla is abstaining from ill deeds which are committed through body or
speech, but apart from abstaining from ill deeds there are many other
aspects of sīla[(38)](#FOOT38). When one abstains from killing it is
kusala sīla. But also when there is no opportunity for killing there can
be kusala sīla: someone can make the resolution to spare the lives of
all living beings, even of the smallest insects he can hardly see. Even
so, someone can make the resolution to abstain from other kinds of
akusala kamma, even when the opportunity to commit them has not arisen.
For example, when a person has found out that intoxicating drinks have a
bad effect, kusala cetanā may take the resolution to refrain in the
future from intoxicating drinks. The wholesome intention at such a
moment can be a condition for abstaining later on when there is an
opportunity for drinking. However, kusala citta is not self, it arises
when there are conditions for it. A moment later akusala citta may arise
and our good intentions are forgotten. We may be annoyed that we do not
live up to our good intentions, but we should remember that kusala citta
and akusala citta arise because of their own conditions. Akusala citta
arises because of conditions which are entirely different from the
conditions for the kusala citta which made the resolution to observe
sīla. We all have accumulated tendencies to kusala and to akusala and it
depends on conditions whether we perform kusala kamma or akusala kamma.
When there is no development of mahā-satipaṭṭhāna it is very difficult
to observe the precepts.

The *Visuddhimagga* mentions in the section on sīla (Chapter I, 53-60)
the “guarding of the sense-doors”, because this can be considered as an
aspect of sīla. When there is mindfulness of, for example, visible
object and visible object is not taken for a ’thing’ or a person but is
known as only a kind of rūpa appearing through the eyes, the eye-door is
guarded. At that moment there is no attachment to visible object, no
aversion towards it, no ignorance about it. Later on we may become
absorbed in what we see and we may cling to it, but at the moment of
mindfulness the doorways are guarded and there is restraint of the
senses. Thus, mindfulness of nāma and rūpa, which is a form of bhāvanā
(mental development), can also be considered as sīla.

Kusala kamma which is *bhāvanā* comprises studying and teaching Dhamma,
samatha, tranquil meditation, and vipassanā, the development of right
understanding of realities. The development of right understanding is
the highest form of kusala kamma because it leads to the eradication of
ignorance. When ignorance has been eradicated there are no more
conditions for rebirth in a next life, one is freed from the cycle of
birth and death.

We have accumulated different degrees of kusala kamma and akusala kamma
and they are capable of producing their appropriate results when there
is opportunity for it. We may be inclined to think that the term
“accumulation” only pertains to kamma, but not only kamma is
accumulated, also tendencies to kusala and akusala are accumulated. When
one steals, akusala kamma is accumulated which is capable of producing
vipāka later on. However vipāka is not the only effect of this
unwholesome deed. Also the tendency to stealing is accumulated and thus
there are conditions that one steals again. We have the potential in us
for all kinds of bad deeds and when there is an opportunity akusala
cetanā can motivate a bad deed through body, speech and mind.

We should distinguish the condition for vipākacitta from the condition
for kusala citta or for akusala citta. Accumulated kamma which produces
vipāka is one type of condition. The accumulated tendencies to good and
evil due to which kusala citta and akusala citta arise are another type
of condition. Thus, there are different types of condition which play
their part in our life.

Tendencies to all kinds of defilements are accumulated. When, for
example, lobha-mūla-citta arises, the tendency to lobha is accumulated
and thus there are conditions for the arising again of lobha-mūla-citta.
We are bound to be attached because we have accumulated such an amount
of lobha. Not only unwholesome tendencies, but also wholesome tendencies
can be accumulated. When there is a moment of right mindfulness of the
reality which appears now, it is a condition for the arising of
mindfulness again, later on. We tend to be attached rather than to be
mindful, but when mindfulness has been accumulated more it will be less
difficult to be mindful. Whatever tendency is accumulated now will bear
on our life in the future[(39)](#FOOT39).

In the *Jātakas* (Birth Stories, Khuddaka Nikāya) we find many examples
of people who committed the same deeds again and again in successive
lives. For example, Devadatta who tried to kill the Buddha had tried to
kill him before, in many former lives when the Buddha was still a
Bodhisatta. We read in the ’Dhammaddhaja Jātaka’ (220) that the Buddha
said:

> “This is not the first time Devadatta has tried to murder me and has
> not even frightened me. He did the same before.”

We read in the ’Dūta Jātaka’ (260) about a monk who was very greedy.
Also in former lives he had been greedy. The Buddha said to him:

> “You were greedy before, monk, as you are now; and in olden days for
> your greed you had your head cleft with a sword.”

The Buddha related a story of one of his past lives: he had such a
craving for the dainty food of a king that he took a piece of rice from
the king’s dish and this nearly cost him his life. After the Buddha had
told this story he explained the four noble Truths and the greedy monk
became an anāgāmī (the noble person who has attained the third stage of
enlightenment). While he listened to the Buddha he must have been
mindful of nāma and rūpa and his paññā developed to the degree that all
clinging to sensuous objects could be eradicated.

In the ’Tila-Muṭṭhi Jātaka (252) we read about a monk who fell easily
into a rage and spoke roughly. The Buddha said:

> “This is not the first time, monks, that this man has been passionate.
> He was just the same before.”

He then related a story of one of his past lives. After the discourse
the Buddha explained the four noble Truths and the passionate monk
became an anāgāmī. He eradicated anger completely. Even though one has
strong inclinations to greed and anger, accumulated for many lives, the
paññā of the eightfold Path can eventually eradicate defilements. The
greedy monk and the angry monk in the above mentioned Jātakas could
attain enlightenment because they had also accumulated sati and paññā.
Listening to the Buddha was the right condition for them to attain the
stage of the anāgāmī.

If we understand that our behaviour now is conditioned by accumulated
inclinations we had in the past we will be less inclined to take it for
’my behaviour’. Each reality which arises is conditioned. Generosity
which arises is conditioned by generosity in the past, it is not ’my
generosity’. Anger which arises is conditioned by anger in the past, it
is not ’my anger’. There is no self who can force citta to be kusala
citta, but conditions can be cultivated so that kusala citta can arise
more often. Important conditions for the arising of kusala citta with
paññā are friendship with a person who has right understanding of the
Dhamma and who can explain the Dhamma in the right way, listening to the
teachings and studying them, and above all mindfulness of the reality
which appears now.

We should consider why we want to perform kusala kamma. Is our aim
kusala vipāka? Kusala kamma produces kusala vipāka because this is the
natural course of things, but if we want to perform kusala kamma in
order to have a pleasant result, such as a happy rebirth, there is
clinging. The aim of the Buddha’s teachings is the eradication of
defilements. Wholesome deeds will be purer if we perform them because we
see the benefit of eliminating defilements. Since human life is very
short we should not lose any opportunity for dāna, sīla or bhāvanā. If
we develop the eightfold Path there will eventually be purification of
all defilements.
