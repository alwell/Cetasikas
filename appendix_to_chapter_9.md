## Appendix to Chapter 9

### Cittas which are accompanied by viriya 


The cittas which are accompanied by viriya are: all akusala cittas and
all sobhana cittas, which include sobhana cittas of the sense-sphere,
rūpāvacara cittas, arūpāvacara cittas and lokuttara cittas. Moreover,
out of the eighteen types of ahetuka cittas there are two types which
are accompanied by viriya: the *mano-dvārāvajjana-citta* which in the
sense-door process performs the function of determining the object
(votthapana) and in the mind-door process the function of adverting to
the object, and the *hasituppāda-citta* which causes smiling in the case
of arahats. The other sixteen types of ahetuka cittas are not
accompanied by viriya. Thus, 16 types of citta out of 89 cittas are not
accompanied by viriya. Altogether there are *73 types of citta
accompanied by viriya.*

The paṭisandhi-citta, the bhavanga-citta and the cuti-citta are not
accompanied by viriya if their functions are performed by
santīraṇa-citta (two types, one kusala vipāka and one akusala
vipāka)[(227)](#FOOT227). If their functions are performed by
mahā-vipākacitta they are accompanied by viriya.

Summarizing the cittas which are accompanied by viriya, they are:

- 12 akusala cittas
- 2 ahetuka cittas
- 8 mahā- kusala cittas
- 8 mahā-vipākacittas
- 8 mahā-kiriyacittas
- 5 rūpāvacara kusala cittas
- 5 rūpāvacara vipākacittas
- 5 rūpāvacara kiriyacittas
- 4 arūpāvacara kusala cittas
- 4 arūpāvacara vipākacittas
- 4 arūpāvacara kiriyacittas
- 8 lokuttara cittas

—altogether: 73

When lokuttara cittas accompanied by the jhānafactors of the different
stages of jhāna are taken into account, there are forty lokuttara cittas
instead of eight; thus, in that case there are hundred-and-five cittas
accompanied by viriya.
