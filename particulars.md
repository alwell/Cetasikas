Right Effort of the eightfold Path
----------------------------------

As we have seen in chapter 9, there are several aspects to kusala
viriya, right effort. It is a *factor of the eightfold Path* when it
accompanies right understanding and right mindfulness of the eightfold
Path and as such it is called *sammā-vāyāma*. This type of effort or
energy is not energy for mindfulness in the future, but energy for
mindfulness right now. When there is right mindfulness of any
characteristic which appears right now, there is also right effort
accompanying the citta at that moment.

We may find that mindfulness does not arise very often. It seems that we
lack a true “sense of urgency”, which is according to the *Atthasālinī*
and the *Visuddhimagga* the proximate cause of right effort.

The *Visuddhimagga* ( IV, 63) explains how there can be a greater sense
of urgency and how the mind should be encouraged. We read:

How does he encourage the mind on an occasion when it should be
encouraged? When his mind is listless owing to sluggishness in the
exercise of understanding or to failure to attain the bliss of peace,
then he should stimulate it by reviewing the eight grounds for a sense
of urgency. These are the four, namely, birth, ageing, sickness and
death, with the suffering of the states of loss as the fifth, and also
the suffering in the past rooted in the round (of rebirth), the
suffering in the future rooted in the round (of rebirth), and the
suffering in the present rooted in the search for nutriment. And he
creates confidence by recollecting the special qualities of the Buddha,
the Dhamma and the Sangha. This is how he encourages the mind on an
occasion when it should be encouraged.

The “states of loss” mentioned by the *Visuddhimagga* are the rebirths
which are “removed from the happy destiny” (XIX, 92, 93), they are
rebirth in the animal world, in the “ghost world”, in the world of
demons (asuras) or in hell planes.

Mindfulness right now can eventually lead to freedom from the danger of
rebirth. We may think with fear of unhappy rebirth and then there is
akusala citta with dosa, not mindfulness. However, we should remember
that even fear can be object of mindfulness. Shortly after the
dosa-mūla-citta has fallen away sati may arise and it can be aware of
whatever characteristic appears at that moment, no matter it is an
unpleasant object or akusala citta. When there is mindfulness there is
also right effort.

We may think time and again of the urgency of mindfulness, but in spite
of that we can notice that sati very seldom arises. We are impatient and
we find it difficult to persevere with the development of satipaṭṭhāna.
The suttas mention several factors which hinder “exertion, application,
striving”. We read in the *Gradual Sayings* (Book of the Tens, Chapter
II, par4, Obstruction) about five mental obstructions which cause
wholesome qualities to decline:

> Herein a monk has doubts and waverings about the Teacher. He is not
> drawn to him, he is not sure about him...
>
> Again, monks, a monk has doubts about the Dhamma, about the Sangha (
> the Order of monks), about the training…he is vexed with his comrades
> in the brahma-life, displeased, troubled in mind, come to a stop. In a
> monk who is thus, his mind inclines not to exertion, to application,
> to perseverance, to striving…

We may doubt whether there can be an “ariyan Sangha”, people who have
developed the eightfold Path and attained enlightenment. We may have
doubts about the usefulness of sati right now, of mindfulness of visible
object, sound or any other reality which appears. At the moment of doubt
there cannot be right effort.

There will be less doubt and more confidence if we listen to the Dhamma
as it is explained by the right person, if we read the scriptures, if we
consider what we learnt and test the meaning of it ourselves. We can
prove the truth of what we learnt by the application of the Dhamma in
daily life.

The above-quoted sutta also mentions five “bondages of the heart” which
hinder the development of good qualities:

> …Herein a monk is not dispassionate in things sensual; desire,
> affections, thirsting, distress and craving have not gone from him…
>
> Again in body a monk is not dispassionate; he is not dispassionate in
> the matter of material shapes; having eaten his bellyful he lives
> given to the pleasure of lying down on back or side, a prey to torpor;
> or he leads the brahma-life with a view to join some order of devas,
> with the thought: By virtue of this way of life or practice or
> austerity or brahma-life I shall become some deva or other. Whatsoever
> monk …has such an object in view, his mind inclines not to exertion,
> to application, to perseverance and striving…

We are infatuated by all the pleasant things of life. At such moments we
forget to develop satipaṭṭhāna. We read in the same sutta that in the
monk who has abandoned the mental obstructions and the “bondages of the
heart”, “growth, not decline, in good states may be looked for.”
However, we should realize that not all obstructions can be overcome at
once. Even the sotāpanna who has eradicated doubt and who has an
unshakable confidence in the Triple Gem is still attached to
sense-pleasures. But he has no wrong view, he does not take attachment
or any other reality for self. He has developed right understanding of
all realities, also of akusala dhammas, by being aware of them when they
appear. The sotāpanna cannot deviate from the eightfold Path anymore.
Since he has realized the truth that all conditioned realities are
impermanent and dukkha, his urgency to be freed from dukkha does not
stem from theoretical understanding of the truth of dukkha, but from the
direct realization of the truth of dukkha. He has a true sense of
urgency which makes him persevere with the development of the eightfold
Path.

When one has just started to develop satipaṭṭhāna, sati does not often
arise. One may wonder how many years it will take before there can be
any progress. When we think of the goal with desire or when we are
afraid of failure there is akusala citta. We may not notice that there
is any progress, but even if there is sometimes one moment of
mindfulness of a reality appearing through one of the six doors, right
understanding can develop little by little. Sati which arises falls
away, but it is never lost, it conditions the arising again of sati
later on. Instead of having desire for enlightenment we should see the
value of right understanding at this moment.

When sati arises it is accompanied by kusala viriya, right effort, which
performs its function of strengthening and supporting citta and the
accompanying cetasikas, and in that way there can be perseverance to
develop right understanding. It takes great patience and courage, even
heroic fortitude, to persevere with mindfulness of all kinds of
realities which appear, also of akusala dhammas we would rather shun as
object of mindfulness.

Right understanding cannot be developed within a short time. The Buddha,
when he was still a Bodhisatta, had to develop wisdom for aeons. He
developed satipaṭṭhāna with great patience and an unshakable energy.
Energy was one of the “perfections” he developed together with
satipaṭṭhāna. He was willing to struggle and strive for an extremely
long time, without becoming disenchanted with all the hardship and
suffering he had to endure, all for the sake of the welfare of other
beings.

The *Dhammasangaṇi* (par13), in its description of the “faculty
(indriya) of energy”, speaks about “zeal and ardour, vigour and
fortitude, the state of unfaltering effort”, “the state of unflinching
endurance and solid grip of the burden.” The Bodhisatta, when he in his
last life was sitting under the Bodhi-tree, had unflinching endurance,
he did not let go of the task he had to fulfil. His vigour and fortitude
were unsurpassed. We read in the *Gradual Sayings* (Book of the Twos,
Chapter I, par5) that the Buddha said to the monks that he did not
shrink back from the struggle and struggled on thus:

> “Gladly would I have my skin and sinews and bones wither and my body’s
> flesh and blood dry up, if only I may hold out until I win what may be
> won by human strength, by human energy, by human striving”. By my
> earnest endeavour, monks, I won enlightenment, I won the unrivalled
> freedom from the bond.

Many of the Buddha’s disciples developed the eightfold Path and attained
enlightenment as well. However, they also had to accumulate right
understanding during countless lives in order to attain enlightenment.
When we read about the lives of the Buddha’s disciples in the
*Thera-therī-gāthā* (Psalms of the Brothers and Sisters) we see that
they also, like we, had periods of slackness with regard to the
development of satipaṭṭhāna. However, ordinary events in their daily
life could stir them and remind them of the urgency to develop right
understanding.

We read that the Thera Uttiya (Thera-gāthā 30) had no purity of sīla and
could not attain enlightenment. The Buddha taught him in brief the
purification of sīla and the purification of view[(63)](#FOOT63) .
Uttiya developed insight and then he became ill. The Commentary to the
“Thera-gāthā” ( the Paramatthadīpanī) relates: “In his anxiety he put
forth every effort and attained arahatship”. He spoke the following
verse with reference to the event which stirred him to continue to
develop insight until he had reached the goal:

```
Since sickness has befallen me, O now 
Let there arise in me true mindfulness.
Sickness has now befallen me--t'is time                                 |
For me no more to dally or delay.

```    

Sickness can remind us that we are not master of our body. What we take
for “our body” and for “our mind” are only conditioned rūpas and nāmas
which are beyond control. If we merely *think* of nāma and rūpa we will
not know them as they are. Mindfulness of the reality which appears now
is the only way to eventually know the true nature of realities.

The Buddha knew the accumulations of beings and, thus, whenever he
preached to someone he could remind him in the way which was most
suitable for him. He often reminded people of the foulness of “this
short-lived body”, in order to stir them to develop satipaṭṭhāna. The
Thera Kimbila (Thera-gāthā 118) was stirred when the Buddha, by his
supernatural power, conjured up the image of a beautiful woman and
showed her passing to old age. The Commentary relates that he was
greatly shaken by this image. He spoke this verse:

 ```                     
 As bidden by some power age over her falls.                              
 Her shape is as another, yet the same.                                   
 Now this myself, who never has left  myself,                              
 Seems other than the self I recollect.   
                                
 ``` 

Kimbila realized that what he took for self are ever-changing phenomena.
Although what we call in conventional terms the “present personality”
which has developed from the “past personality”, there isn’t any reality
which is self. The phenomena of the present moment fall away immediately
as soon as they have arisen and are completely gone. The commentary
relates that Kimbila, while he considered the truth of impermanence, was
yet more strongly agitated. He listened to the Buddha, became a monk and
attained arahatship.

There are time and again signs of foulness and decay in our body. Our
body is susceptible to decay, and death can come at any moment. We do
not know when the last citta of our life, the dying-consciousness, will
arise. For those who have accumulated conditions for sati the thought of
death can remind them to be aware.

We read that the Buddha’s disciples, when they were stirred by an event
in their life, “put forth energy and strove with passionate ardour”. We
read, for example, in the “Therīgāthā (29) that Sāmā could not find
peace of mind during the twenty five years she was a nun. In her old age
she heard a sermon of the Buddha which stirred her, and she attained
arahatship. We read that she said: “To free my path from all that causes
dukkha, I strove with passionate ardour, and I won!” When we read these
words we may misunderstand them. We are so used to thinking of effort as
effort exerted by a self that we can hardly imagine how there can be
effort arising because of its own conditions. Realities appear already
through the five senses and through the mind-door. Visible object, for
example, appears time and again. We could begin to investigate its
characteristic until it is realized as *just visible object appearing
through eyesense, not something or somebody.* There can be striving
without the concept of self who strives.

Even though we are only starting to develop the Path events in our life
can remind us to be aware now, just as they reminded the Buddha’s
disciples. At times we may have doubts about the benefit of sati, or it
may happen that we are absorbed by our work or our circle of friends, or
we may be infatuated by all the pleasant things of life, without
mindfulness of such moments. Although we know in theory that any reality
can be object of mindfulness, there may be a long period of sluggishness
in our life. However, a painful event such as the loss of someone who is
dear to us may remind us of the true nature of reality; this can become
our “goad” which stirs us. If we truly see that even one moment of right
understanding is beneficial we will have courage to continue with the
development of satipaṭṭhāna and then there is right effort which arises
because of its own conditions. We can come to understand that life
without the development of right understanding is utterly meaningless.

### Questions

1.  What can obstruct right effort?
2.  When we are thinking of the goal with discouragement, what can be
    done to persevere?
3.  How can signs of foulness and decay in the body be reminders of
    awareness of the present reality?
4.  Why is listening to the Dhamma as it is explained by the right
    person helpful for the arising of sati?Determination (adhimokkha)
--------------------------

Adhimokkha, determination or resolution, is another cetasika among the
six “particulars” which arises with cittas of the four jātis but not
with every citta.

The *Visuddhimagga* ( XIV, 151) gives the following definition of
adhimokkha:

The act of resolving is resolution. It has the characteristic of
conviction. Its function is not to grope. It is manifested as
decisiveness. Its proximate cause is a thing to be convinced about. It
should be regarded as like a boundary-post owing to its immovableness
with regard to the object.

The “Paramattha Mañjūsā” (489), the commentary to the *Visuddhimagga*,
states that:

> “ the act of resolving should be understood as the act of being
> convinced about an object”.

The *Atthasālinī* (I, Part IV, Chapter I, 133) gives a definition
similar to the one of the *Visuddhimagga*[(57)](#FOOT57)

Adhimokkha is not the same as what we usually mean by the words
“determination” and “decision” in conventional language. In order to
understand the characteristic of adhimokkha we should know which types
of citta it accompanies.

Since adhimokkha is one of the “particulars” it accompanies cittas of
the four jātis and thus it can be kusala, akusala, vipāka or kiriya. As
we have seen, the “particulars” do not arise with every citta.
Adhimokkha does not accompany the dvi-pañcaviññāṇas (sense-cognitions)
which are accompanied only by the “universals”, not by other types of
cetasikas. Seeing-consciousness, for example, arises at the eye-base and
sees visible object. It does not need, apart from the seven
“universals”, adhimokkha or any other cetasika in order to see visible
object.

Adhimokkha does not arise either with the type of moha-mūla-citta (citta
rooted in ignorance) which is *accompanied by doubt (vicikicchā).* When
there is doubt there cannot be at the same time the cetasika adhimokkha
which “does not grope” and is “convinced” about the object.

Adhimokkha accompanies all cittas other than the afore-mentioned cittas.
It arises in the sense-door process as well as in the mind-door process.
Adhimokkha is one among the cetasikas which assist citta in cognizing
its object. Adhimokkha also accompanies the cittas which do not arise in
a process: the paṭisandhi-citta, the bhavanga-citta and the cuti-citta.
It is “convinced” about the object these cittas experience.

When we hear the word “decision” or “determination”, we usually
associate this word with a decision we have to consider carefully. We
may not have expected adhimokkha to arise in a sense-door process, but,
as we have seen, it arises in sense-door processes as well as in
mind-door processes and it assists the citta in cognizing the object.

Adhimokkha which accompanies akusala citta is determination which is
akusala. When one, for example, speaks harshly or hits someone else,
there is akusala adhimokkha which is convinced about the object of
aversion. Adhimokkha which accompanies kusala citta is determination
which is kusala. When one, for example, decides with kusala citta to
study the Dhamma, kusala adhimokkha accompanies the kusala citta.
However, at such a moment there are also many other wholesome cetasikas
accompanying the kusala citta and adhimokkha is only one of them. It is
difficult to know exactly what adhimokkha is. There is, for example,
kusala cetanā which “wills” kusala, there is non-attachment, alobha, and
there are many other cetasikas which each have their own task in
assisting the citta to perform its function. They all take part in “
deciding” to study the Dhamma.

When one develops calm there is adhimokkha which is determined, sure
about the object, which is in this case an object of samatha. When jhāna
is attained adhimokkha accompanies the jhāna-citta and it performs its
function of being determined as to the object of absorption.

When one develops right understanding of nāma and rūpa, there is
adhimokkha accompanying the kusala citta. We may believe that *we* can
decide to make sati arise, but there is *no self* who can decide this.
When there are the appropriate conditions for sati and paññā they arise
and then there is also adhimokkha which performs its function while it
accompanies the kusala citta. When one begins to develop right
understanding of nāma and rūpa, there will be doubt as to their
different characteristics. When there is doubt adhimokkha does not
arise. When there is right mindfulness of the nāma or rūpa which
appears, adhimokkha performs its function of being “convinced”, sure
about the object.

Adhimokkha which accompanies lokuttara citta is “convinced”, sure about
the object which is nibbāna.

Adhimokkha is not self; it is saṅkhāra dhamma, a conditioned dhamma
which arises and falls away with the citta it accompanies. It performs
its function only while it is accompanying the citta and then it falls
away together with the citta. If the next citta is accompanied by
adhimokkha it is another adhimokkha and this falls away again.

Since adhimokkha arises with all cittas except the ten pañca-viññāṇas
and the type of moha-mūla-citta which is accompanied by doubt, it arises
with seventy-eight cittas in all[(58)](#FOOT58).

Energy (viriya)
---------------

Viriya, energy or effort, is another cetasika among the “particulars”
which arises with cittas of the four jātis but not with every citta. The
*Visuddhimagga* ( XIV, 137) states concerning viriya:

Energy (viriya) is the state of one who is vigorous (vīra). Its
characteristic is marshalling (driving). Its function is to consolidate
conascent states (the accompanying citta and cetasikas). It is
manifested as non-collapse. Because of the words “Bestirred, he strives
wisely” (*Gradual Sayings* II, 115), its proximate cause is a sense of
urgency; or its proximate cause is grounds for the initiation of energy.
When rightly initiated, it should be regarded as the root of all
attainments.

Viriya which is the root of all attainments is right effort, viriya
accompanying kusala citta. Since viriya accompanies cittas of the four
jātis, there is also akusala viriya, viriya accompanying vipākacitta and
viriya accompanying kiriyacitta.

The *Atthasālinī* (I, Part IV, Chapter I, 120,121) gives a definition of
viriya which is similar to the one given by the *Visuddhimagga.* Apart
from this definition it gives first another one and here it deals with
viriya under the aspect of “controlling faculty” or *indriya*. The Pāli
term “indriya” means “governing or ruling principle”. When kusala viriya
has been developed it becomes a “controlling faculty”. The controlling
faculty of viriya “controls” or inhibits laziness, a defilement opposed
to energy[(59)](#FOOT59). We read in the *Atthasālinī*:

> From its overcoming idleness it is a controlling faculty in the sense
> of predominance …Its characteristic is strengthening, and grasp or
> support. As an old house stands when strengthened by new pillars, so
> the aspirant (meditator), when strengthened by energy, does not fall
> off or deteriorate as to moral states. Thus should the characteristic
> of strengthening be understood…

The *Atthasālinī* then uses a simile of a small army which, if it goes
to battle, might be repulsed. However, when they are supported by a
strong reinforcement sent by the king, they can defeat the hostile army.
We read:

> …thus energy does not allow associated states to recede, to retreat;
> it uplifts, supports them. Hence it has been said that energy has the
> characteristic of supporting.

The word “energy” as it is used in conventional language does not render
the precise meaning of viriya. When we for example say that we are full
of energy, what do we mean? Energy for what? Is it energy accompanying
akusala citta or energy accompanying kusala citta? Besides, there are
also vipākacittas and kiriyacittas which are accompanied by viriya. We
are inclined to take energy for self, but energy is saṅkhāra dhamma, a
conditioned dhamma. Energy is conditioned by the citta and the other
cetasikas it accompanies and thus there is a different kind of energy
with different cittas. In order to have more understanding about viriya
we should study which types of cittas it accompanies.

Viriya accompanies all akusala cittas and all sobhana
cittas[(60)](#FOOT60) (including jhānacittas and lokuttara cittas), but
it does not arise with all vipākacittas and with all kiriyacittas.
Viriya does not accompany the dvi-pañca-viññāṇas, the sense-cognitions.
Seeing or hearing do not need viriya in order to experience their
objects. The mind-door adverting-consciousness,
*mano-dvārāvajjana-citta* and the *hasituppāda-citta* which causes
smiling in the case of arahats are the only ahetuka cittas (rootless
cittas) which are accompanied by viriya[(61)](#FOOT61).

We read in the *Visuddhimagga* that the *function of viriya* is *to
consolidate conascent states.* Viriya strengthens, supports the citta
and the other cetasikas it accompanies so that they can carry out their
work and do not “collapse”.

Viriya accompanies every kusala citta and it supports the citta and
accompanying cetasikas so that they can carry out their work in a
wholesome way. When there is loving kindness, it is strengthened and
supported by kusala viriya. If there were no viriya accompanying the
kusala citta, no kusala could be performed. Also when the citta is
akusala citta, viriya accompanies the citta and the cetasikas so that
they can carry out their work in the unwholesome way. Viriya accompanies
every akusala citta. When there is anger, dosa, it is strengthened and
supported by viriya. Viriya which accompanies akusala citta is wrong
effort and viriya which accompanies kusala citta is right effort.

Kusala viriya can be energy for dāna, for sīla, for samatha or for
vipassanā. It depends on conditions which type of kusala arises at a
particular moment. If one wants, for example, to subdue defilements
through the development of calm and one knows how to develop calm, there
is energy and perseverance with the development of calm. If one’s goal
is knowing realities as they are there are conditions for energy for
vipassanā. This kind of energy or effort arises together with the citta
which is mindful of a nāma or rūpa appearing now, at this moment. Right
effort arises because of its own conditions; there is no self who can
exert himself. When we have a notion of self who has to make an effort
to be aware, there is wrong effort instead of right effort. Right effort
is a conditioned dhamma, saṅkhāra dhamma, which arises because of its
own conditions. It does not last, it falls away immediately with the
citta it accompanies and then wrong effort may arise.

As we read in the definition of the *Visuddhimagga*, the proximate cause
of viriya is “a sense of urgency or grounds for the initiation of
energy”. Birth, old age and death can remind us of the urgency to
develop right understanding which eventually will lead to freedom from
the cycle of birth and death. When we are “urged” to be mindful of
realities, there is no self who makes an effort to be mindful. Right
effort which is a reality arising because of its own conditions
strengthens and supports the citta with mindfulness. There is energy,
courage and perseverance to develop the eightfold Path since this is the
only way leading to the end of dukkha.

The *Visuddhimagga* and the *Atthasālinī*, when they mention that the
proximate cause of viriya is a sense of urgency, quote the words,
“bestirred, he strives wisely”, from a sutta of the *Gradual Sayings*
(Book of the Fours, Chapter XII, par3, The Goad). In this sutta we read
about four kinds of horses. One horse is already stirred to activity
when he sees the shadow of the goadstick, whereas another one is not
stirred by that, but is only stirred when his coat is pricked by the
goad. Another one is stirred only when his flesh is pierced by the goad.
We read about the fourth kind of horse:

Once more, monks, we may have a goodly thorough-bred steed, which is
stirred, feels agitation neither at the sight of the goadstick nor when
his coat is pricked, nor yet when his flesh is pierced with the
goadstick; but when he is pierced to the very bone he is stirred…

We then read about four kinds of people who are compared to these
horses:

> In this case, monks, here we may have a certain goodly thorough-bred
> man who hears it said that in such and such a village or township is a
> woman or a man afflicted or dead. Thereat he is stirred, he feels
> agitation. Thus agitated he strictly applies himself. Thus applied he
> both realizes in his own person the supreme truth, and sees it by
> penetrating it with wisdom…
>
> Again, monks, here we may have a goodly thoroughbred man who does not
> hear it said that in such or such a village or township is a woman or
> a man afflicted or dead, but with his own eyes sees it. Thereupon he
> is stirred…
>
> Then again, monks, here we may have a certain goodly thorough-bred man
> who does not hear it said…nor yet with his own eyes sees a woman or
> man afflicted or dead, but his own kinsman or blood-relation is
> afflicted or dead. Thereupon he is stirred…
>
> Once more, monks, here we may have a goodly thoroughbred man who
> neither hears it said…nor yet with his own eyes sees… nor is his own
> kinsman or blood-relation afflicted or dead, but he himself is
> stricken with painful bodily feelings, grievous, sharp, racking,
> distracting, discomforting, that drain the life away. Thereat he is
> stirred, he feels agitation. Being so stirred he strictly applies
> himself. Thus applied he both realizes with his own person the supreme
> truth and sees it by penetrating it with wisdom…

Sickness, old age and death are realities of daily life which can remind
us of the urgency to develop right understanding, they are like a
“goadstick” which can “stir” us. They are the proximate cause of right
effort, which is energy for mindfulness of the reality appearing at the
present moment.

Viriya is the “root of all attainments”, as we read in the definition by
the *Visuddhimagga*. Right effort is an *indriya*, controlling faculty,
which has to be developed together with the other indriyas for the
attainment of jhāna and the attainment of enlightenment. As the
*Atthasālinī* states, viriya is the indriya which “controls” or inhibits
laziness. Laziness is an obstruction to jhāna and to enlightenment.
Right effort can also be seen under the aspect of *path-factor* and as
such it is called *sammā-vāyāma of the eightfold Path.* Right effort has
to accompany right understanding, sammā-diṭṭhi, of the eightfold Path in
order to be a path-factor. Right effort of the eightfold Path develops
through mahā-satipaṭṭhāna, the “four applications of mindfulness”. When
there is mindfulness of the reality which appears at the present moment
there is also right effort.

Viriya is one of the *factors of enlightenment, bojjhangas.* The factors
of enlightenment are: mindfulness (sati), investigation of the Dhamma
(dhammavicaya, which is paññā), viriya, enthusiasm (pīti), calm
(passaddhi), concentration (samādhi) and equanimity (upekkhā). When the
enlightenment factors have been developed they lead to the realization
of the four noble Truths. The enlightenment factors reach completion
through the development of mahā-satipaṭṭhāna[(62)](#FOOT62).

Thus we see that there are different aspects to right effort. We read in
the scriptures about “ four right endeavours” and these are aspects of
right effort. We read for example in the *Middle Length Sayings* (III,
141, the Analysis of the Truths) that Sāriputta explained to the monks
the four noble Truths. He spoke about dukkha, its origination, its
cessation and the way leading to its cessation , the eightfold Path. He
explained about right effort, one of the factors of the eightfold Path,
and he pointed out that there are four right endeavours:

> And what, your reverences, is right endeavour? As to this, your
> reverences, a monk generates desire, endeavours, stirs up energy,
> exerts his mind and strives for the non-arising of evil unskilled
> states that have not arisen…for the getting rid of evil unskilled
> states that have arisen…for the arising of skilled states that have
> not arisen…for the maintenance, preservation, increase, maturity,
> development and completion of skilled states that have arisen. This,
> your reverences, is called right endeavour.

When there is mindfulness of visible object which appears now, seeing
which appears now, sound which appears now, hearing which appears now,
or any other reality which appears now, right understanding of the
eightfold Path is being developed. This is the most effective way to
avoid akusala, to overcome it, to make kusala arise and to maintain
kusala and bring it to perfection. At the moment of right mindfulness
right effort performs its task of strengthening the kusala citta so that
there is perseverance with the development of the eightfold Path.

Seven cetasikas, the *universals* (sabbacitta-sādhāranā), arise with
every citta. Besides these seven cetasikas there are *six cetasikas*,
the *particulars* (pakiṇṇakā)*,* which accompany *cittas of the four
jātis but not every citta.* Both the “universals” and the “particulars”
are of the same jāti as the citta they accompany. Thus, they can be
kusala, akusala, vipāka or kiriya. In addition to the “universals” and
the “particulars” there are also akusala cetasikas which arise only with
akusala cittas and sobhana (beautiful) cetasikas which arise only with
sobhana cittas.
