## Different Groups of Defilements Part I

We are inclined to think that our suffering in life are due to causes
outside ourselves, to unpleasant events or to other people’s behaviour.
However, the real cause of sorrow is within ourselves. Our defilements
lead to sorrow. The goal of the Buddha’s teachings is the eradication of
defilements and this cannot be achieved unless right understanding of
realities has been developed. All three parts of the Tipiṭaka, the
Vinaya, the Suttanta and the Abhidhamma, have been taught in order to
encourage people to develop the way which leads to the end of
defilements. If we do not forget this goal, no matter which part of the
scriptures we are reading, we can profit to the full from our study.

In the Abhidhamma realities are classified in numerous ways. In the
Third Book of the *Dhammasangaṇi* akusala dhammas have been classified
in different groups. The study of these different classifications can
help us to see the danger of akusala. However, in order to really know
our defilements we should be aware of them when they appear. For
example, we know in theory that there is clinging to visible object,
sound, odour, flavour, tangible object and to mental objects, but when
there is mindfulness we learn that even now, after a moment of seeing or
a moment of hearing, attachment can arise and that it is bound to arise
again and again. Defilements are not merely abstract categories, they
are realities which can appear at any time and there are many more
moments of them than we ever thought.

The fourteen akusala cetasikas which arise with the akusala cittas in
various combinations can be classified in different groups. Each of
these classifications shows a particular aspect and function of the
akusala cetasikas. Some cetasikas occur in several of these groups, and
each time a different aspect is shown. Attachment occurs in all of these
groups and this reminds us of the many ways of clinging to different
kinds of objects.

One of the groups of defilements is the *āsavas*. Āsava can be
translated as canker, poison or intoxicant. There are four āsavas
(*Dhammasangaṇi* par1096-1100):

1. the canker of sensuous desire, kāmāsava
2. the canker of becoming, bhavāsava
3. the canker of wrong view, diṭṭhāsava
4. the canker of ignorance, avijjāsava

The *Atthasālinī* (I, Part I, Chapter II, 48) explains that āsavas flow
from the senses and the mind. In all planes where there is nāma arising
āsavas occur, even in the highest plane of existence which is the fourth
arūpa-brahma plane. The āsavas are like liquor which has fermented for a
long time, the *Atthasālinī* explains. The āsavas are like poisonous
drugs or intoxicants. The *Visuddhimagga* (XXII, 56) states that the
āsavas are exuding “from unguarded sense-doors like water from cracks in
a pot, in the sense of constant trickling”. The āsavas keep on flowing
from birth to death, they are also flowing at this moment. Are we not
attached to what we see? Then there is the canker of sensuous desire,
kāmāvara. Seeing experiences visible object, and shortly after seeing
has fallen away there are most of the time akusala cittas rooted in
attachment, aversion or ignorance. When the object is pleasant there is
likely to be attachment to the object because we have accumulated such a
great deal of attachment. We are attached to visible object, sound,
odour, flavour and tangible object. We are infatuated with the objects
we experience through the senses and we want to go on experiencing them.
Because of our foolish attachment to what is actually impermanent we
have to continue to be in the cycle of birth and death. We have to be
reborn again and again until the cankers have been extinguished. The
arahat has eradicated the cankers, he does not have to be reborn again.

We may not understand that birth is sorrowful, but when right
understanding has been developed we will see that all that is
impermanent is sorrowful. We cling to all we experience through the
senses, we cling to life. Clinging is deeply accumulated; even the first
javana-cittas of our life were lobha-mūla-cittas, cittas rooted in
attachment, and this is the case for every living being.

The canker of desire for rebirth, bhavāsava, is another one of the
āsavas. Even the anāgāmī who has eradicated all clinging to sensuous
objects, can still have clinging to becoming or rebirth. So long as
there is attachment to any kind of rebirth one has to continue to be in
the cycle of birth and death.

The canker of wrong view, diṭṭhāsava, comprises, according to the
*Dhammasangaṇi* (par1099) the conceiving of all speculative theories
such as eternalism, annihilationism, theories about the world, the soul
and the body. So long as one has not attained enlightenment one tends to
cling to the concept of self and this is so deeply rooted that it is
extremely hard to eradicate it.

The canker of ignorance, avijjāsava, is moha cetasika. It is ignorance
of the four noble Truths, of the past, the future or both, and of the
“Dependant Origination” (*Dhammasangaṇi*, par1100). We have innumerable
moments of ignorance. Ignorance is dangerous, at the moment it arises we
do not realize that there is ignorance.

We are time and again overcome by the āsavas. It is hard for us to see
their danger. We cannot help being attached to the objects we experience
through the senses. How could we prevent ourselves from liking pleasant
objects? The Buddha warned people of the danger of sense-pleasures. We
read in the *Middle Length Sayings* (I, no. 22, The Parable of the
Water-snake) that the Buddha explained about the things which are
“stumbling blocks” to the monk Ariṭṭha who had wrong understanding of
the Dhamma. The Buddha stated about sense-pleasures:

> …Sense-pleasures are said by me to be of little satisfaction, of much
> pain, of much tribulation, wherein is more peril. Sense-pleasures are
> likened by me to a skeleton…to a lump of meat…to a torch of dry
> grass…to a pit of glowing embers…to a dream…to something borrowed…to
> the fruits of a tree…to a slaughter-house…to an impaling
> stake…sense-pleasures are likened by me to a snake’s head, of much
> pain, of much tribulation, wherein is more peril….

When one is still infatuated with sense-pleasures such words are hard to
grasp. We may not like to hear that sense-pleasures are as sorrowful and
dangerous as the things the Buddha compares them to. At the moment of
attachment the object which is experienced seems to be so pleasant and
we fail to see that we are lured by attachment. It is wisdom, paññā,
which sees the danger of sense-pleasures.

The anāgāmī and the arahat fully understand the danger of
sense-pleasures; they have no conditions for the arising of the canker
of sensuous desire, kāmāsava, because it has been eradicated. When
understanding of realities begins to develop it cannot yet achieve
detachment from sense-pleasures. Some people are inclined to think that
they must first of all become detached, before they can begin to develop
right understanding of nāma and rūpa. However, this is not the right way
of practice. Right understanding of whatever reality appears, even if it
is attachment, should be developed. Only paññā which knows nāma and rūpa
as they are can eventually bring about detachment.

The *Visuddhimagga* states about the āsavas that they “exude from
unguarded sense-doors”. The sense-doors are “guarded” through the
development of satipaṭṭhāna. We read in the *Gradual Sayings* (Book of
the Threes, Chapter II, par16, The Sure Course) that a monk who
possesses three qualities is “proficient in the practice leading to the
Sure Course” and “has strong grounds for the destruction of the āsavas”.
These three qualities are moderation in eating, the guarding of the six
doors and vigilance. We read concerning the guarding of the six doors:

> And how does he keep watch over the door of his sense faculties?
>
> Herein, a monk, seeing an object with the eye, does not grasp at the
> general features or at the details thereof. Since coveting and
> dejection, evil, unprofitable states might overwhelm one who dwells
> with the faculty of the eye uncontrolled, he applies himself to such
> control, sets a guard over the faculty of the eye, attains control
> thereof….

The same is said about the other doorways. The six doorways should be
guarded. How does one, when seeing an object with the eye, not “grasp at
the general features or at the details thereof”? In being mindful of the
reality which appears. This is the way to see realities as they are, to
see them as impermanent, dukkha and non-self. However, even the
sotāpanna who has eradicated the “canker of wrong view”, diṭṭhāsava,
still clings to sensuous objects. Even someone who has realized the
arising and falling away of visible object which appears, of sound which
appears, may still cling to them. Clinging has been accumulated from
life to life, how then could one become detached at once?

There are four stages of enlightenment, and at each stage defilements
are progressively eradicated. Paññā has to grow keener and keener in
order to be able to eradicate them. The lokuttara magga-citta
(supramundane path-consciousness) which, at the first stage of
enlightenment (the stage of the sotāpanna), experiences nibbāna for the
first time, eradicates only the canker of wrong view. The sotāpanna
still has the canker of sensuous desire, the canker of desire for
rebirth and the canker of ignorance. He still has desire, but it has
become less gross than the desire of the non-ariyan, the “worldling”
(puthujjana). The magga-citta of the sakadāgāmī (who has attained the
second stage of enlightenment) does not eradicate desire, but desire has
become attenuated more. The magga-citta of the anāgāmī (who has attained
the third stage of enlightenment) eradicates the canker of sensuous
desire, but he still has the canker of desire for rebirth and the canker
of ignorance. The magga-citta of the arahat eradicates the canker of
desire for rebirth and the canker of ignorance. The arahat is
“canker-freed”.

Another group of defilements is the group of the *Floods* or *Oghas*
(*Dhammasangaṇi* par1151). There are four floods which are the same
defilements as the cankers, but the classification as floods shows a
different aspect. The floods are:

- the flood of sensuous desire (kāmogha)
- the flood of desire for rebirth (bhavogha)
- the flood of wrong view (diṭṭhogha)
- the flood of ignorance (avijjogha)

We read in the *Atthasālinī* (I, Part I, Chapter II, 49) that the
“floods” submerge a person again and again in the cycle of birth and
death.

The *Visuddhimagga* (XXII, 56) states:

> …The Floods are so called in the sense of sweeping away into the ocean
> of becoming, and in the sense of being hard to cross….

The classification of defilements under the aspect of floods reminds us
of their danger. A flood is dangerous, it can drown us.

In the suttas the cycle of birth and death has been compared to a
dangerous ocean, which has to be crossed. We read in the *Kindred
Sayings* (IV, Saḷāyatana-vagga, Fourth Fifty, Chapter 3, par187, Ocean):

> “The ocean! The ocean!” monks, says the ignorant worldling. But that,
> monks, is not the ocean in the discipline of the ariyan. That ocean
> (of the worldling), monks, is a heap of water, a great flood of water.
>
> The eye of a man, monks, is the ocean. Its impulse is made of objects.
> Who so endures that object-made impulse,- of him, monks, it is said,
> “he has crossed over. That ocean of the eye, with its waves and
> whirlpools, its sharks and demons, the brahmin has crossed and gone
> beyond. He stands on dry ground”….

When there is no more clinging to the eye and objects, or to all the
other realities, one has “crossed over”. Further on we read that the
Buddha spoke the verse:


   
 ``` 
 Who so has crossed this monster-teem 
 ing sea, 
 With its devils and fearsome waves i 
 mpassable, 
 ``Versed in the lore'', ``living the 
 holy life'', 
 ``Gone to world's end'', and ``gone 
 beyond'' he is called. 

 ``` 


The arahat has crossed the sea of the cycle of birth and death
(saṁsāra), he has gone to the world’s end, he has “gone beyond”.

The danger of being drowned is real. We are infatuated with visible
object, sound, smell, and all the other objects which can be experienced
through the six doors. Every time we like one of the sense objects we
are in the flood of sensuous desire, we fail to see the danger of this
flood, we are forgetful. Many times we are forgetful and we do not even
want to be mindful. The Buddha reminded people that pleasant objects do
not last and that we all have to suffer old age, sickness and death. If
we listen to the Buddha’s words without developing understanding we
cannot grasp their real meaning. If we develop right understanding of
all realities which appear we will know more clearly when there is
clinging to the objects we experience and we will come to see the danger
of clinging. The floods are eradicated at the different stages of
enlightenment, at the same stages as the corresponding cankers.

The *Yokes* or *Yogas* are another group of defilements. This group
consists again of the same defilements as the cankers and the floods. We
read in the *Atthasālinī* (I, Part I, Chapter II, 49) that the “yokes”
tie a person to the cycle of birth and death.

The *Visuddhimagga* (XXII, 56) states about the yoghas (here translated
as bonds):

> The Bonds are so called because they do not allow disengagement from
> an object and disengagement from suffering (dukkha).

The four yoghas are:

1. the yoke of sensuous desire, kāmayogha
2. the yoke of desire for rebirth, bhavayogha
3. the yoke of wrong view, diṭṭhiyogha
4. the yoke of ignorance, avijjāyogha

Thus, the yokes are the same defilements as the cankers and the floods,
but the classification by way of yokes reminds us that we are tied to
the round of rebirths. The different yokes are eradicated at the same
stages of enlightenment as the corresponding cankers and floods

### Questions

1. What is the use of classifying the same cetasikas as cankers, floods
 and yokes?
2. Do we have to be detached first before we develop wisdom?
3. We may agree that sense-pleasures are dangerous, but attachment to
 them still arises. How can one really see their danger?
