The Three Abstinences (virati-cetasikas) 
----------------------------------------

There are twentyfive sobhana cetasikas in all which arise only with
sobhana cittas. Nineteen among these arise with every sobhana citta,
whereas six of them do not arise with every sobhana citta. Among these
six sobhana cetasikas there are three which are *abstinences* or
*virati-cetasikas*. They are:

- abstinence from wrong speech, vaci-duccarita virati
- abstinence from wrong action, kāya-duccarita virati
- abstinence from wrong livelihood, ājīva-duccarita virati

As regards abstinence from wrong speech, this is abstinence from lying,
slandering, harsh speech and idle, frivolous talk. Abstinence from wrong
action comprises abstinence from killing, stealing and sexual
misconduct. Abstinence from wrong livelihood is abstinence from wrong
speech and wrong action committed for the sake of one’s livelihood.

We read in the *Atthasālinī* (I, Book I, Part IV, Chapter I, 133) about
the three kinds of abstinences:

> …As regards characteristic, etc., it has been said that each of these
> three does not trespass nor tread on objects of the other two. They
> have the function of shrinking from the same; and they have faith
> (saddhā), sense of shame (hiri), fear of blame (ottappa), contentment
> and more, as proximate antecedents. They should be regarded as
> produced by the averted state of the mind from evil action.

The *Visuddhimagga* (XIV, 155) gives a similar definition.

We read that each of the three does not tread on objects of the other
two. In the case of cittas of the sense-sphere (kāmāvacara cittas) these
three kinds of abstinence arise one at a time, since there is abstinence
from one kind of evil at a time. When we, for example, abstain from
harsh speech, the cetasika which is abstinence from wrong speech
accompanies the mahā-kusala citta and we do not abstain from wrong
action at the same time, since there is only one citta at a time. When
we are harshly spoken to and we do not answer back there is not always
kusala citta with abstinence from wrong speech. We may keep silent with
citta rooted in ignorance or with citta rooted in aversion and then
there is akusala citta. If we abstain from retorting unpleasant speech
with kindness and patience there is kusala citta accompanied by the
cetasika which is abstinence from wrong speech.

As we have seen, confidence in wholesomeness (saddhā), shame (hiri),
fear of blame (ottappa) and contentment are among the proximate causes
of the abstinences. When there is contentment or fewness of wishes there
are favourable conditions for observing morality.

As regards abstinence from wrong livelihood for laymen, we read in the
*Gradual Sayings* (III, Book of the Fives, Chapter XVIII, par 7) about
five kinds of trades laymen should abstain from:

> Monks, these five trades ought not to be plied by a lay-disciple. What
> five?
>
> Trade in weapons, trade in human beings, trade in flesh, trade in
> spirits and trade in poison.
>
> Verily, monks, these five trades ought not to be plied by a
> lay-disciple.

As to trade in flesh, the commentary (Manorathapūraṇi) explains: “He
breeds and sells pigs, deer, etc.” It is also wrong livelihood to
receive bribes for services which are one’s duty to perform, or bribes
for something one ought not to do.

There is also wrong livelihood for monks. The monk should not try to
obtain the requisites of robes, almsfood, dwelling and medicine with
unlawful means, such as by way of hinting or talking in a clever way. He
should not disparage others in order to obtain gain and
honour[(185)](#FOOT185). The monk’s life should be a life of contentment
with little. If he realizes that the observance of the Vinaya should not
be separated from the development of right understanding he will be able
to lead a life of purity.

When someone lies or uses dishonest means in order to obtain something
for himself he acts in this way because of selfish desire. He hopes to
gain something, but sooner or later he will suffer unpleasant results.
Whenever we give in to wrong speech or wrong action we are enslaved and
we are blinded, we do not realize the consequences. At that moment there
is no shame which shrinks from evil and no fear of the consequences of
evil. While we abstain from evil there are confidence in wholesomeness,
shame and fear of blame and there is no selfish desire. Understanding,
paññā, may or may not accompany the kusala citta which abstains from
evil. As right understanding develops there will be less clinging to the
concept of self and consequently there will be more conditions to
abstain from wrong speech, wrong action and wrong livelihood.

It is not easy to know when there is kusala citta accompanied by one of
the three abstinences. So long as it is not known precisely when there
is kusala citta and when akusala citta, the characteristics of the
cetasikas which are abstention from wrong speech, wrong action and wrong
livelihood cannot be known either. It is of no use to try to focus on
these realities since there are many sobhana cetasikas accompanying the
kusala citta while we abstain from evil and it is difficult to know
their different characteristics. When the characteristic of abstinence
appears there can be mindfulness of it in order to be able to realize
that it is not self who abstains.

There are different degrees of abstinence and the *Atthasālinī* (I, Book
I, Part III, Chapter VI, 103, 104) distinguishes between three kinds:
abstaining “in spite of opportunity obtained”, abstaining because of
observance (of precepts) and abstaining by way of eradication. As to the
first kind we read:

When they who have not undertaken to observe any precept, but who
reflecting on their own birth, age, experience, etc. and saying “It is
not fit for us to do such a bad thing”, do not transgress an object
actually met with, the abstinence is to be considered as “in spite of
opportunity”…

Thus, also those who have not undertaken the precepts can have shame and
fear of blame and abstain from wrong speech, wrong action and wrong
livelihood. Although the opportunity for wrong speech or wrong action
presents itself, they abstain from it when they take into consideration
the family they belong to, the education they have had and their
experience. They do not want to behave like fools and they fear the
consequences of evil conduct.

The second kind of abstention is by way of observance of the precepts.
When someone has undertaken the precepts and he considers it beneficial
to observe them this can be a condition to abstain from wrong conduct.
There are many degrees of observing the precepts. One’s morality, sīla,
may be limited (Vis. I, 31). Someone may have the intention not to kill
living beings, but when his health or his life is in danger, or his
relatives insist that he should kill, for example, insects, he may not
be able to observe the precept which is abstention from killing. Thus,
his morality is limited, it is not enduring. Only through the
development of right understanding can morality become enduring.

The sotāpanna has eradicated wrong view and, thus, when he observes the
precepts, he does not take the observing for self. He will never
transgress the five precepts, even if his life is in danger, and, thus,
his morality is of a higher degree than the morality of the non-ariyan.
We read about the third kind of abstinence, abstinence by way of
eradication, mentioned by the *Atthasālinī*, that it should be
understood as associated with the ariyan path:

> …When that Path has once arisen, not even the thought, “we will kill a
> creature”, arises in the ariyans.

If right understanding of realities is not developed, all kinds of
defilements can arise on account of the objects which are experienced.
When a pleasant object is experienced through the eyes, we tend
immediately to be infatuated with it. We should realize that what is
seen is only visible object, a kind of rūpa which does not last. Visible
object can be seen just for a moment, it cannot be owned. Still, we make
ourselves believe that we can own it. We want to get it for ourselves
and because of it we may even commit evil deeds. In the ultimate sense
there are no people or things, only nāma and rūpa which arise and then
fall away immediately.

When we realize the consequences of evil conduct we will be urged to
develop right understanding which can eradicate defilements. We read in
the *Gradual Sayings* (III, Book of the Fives, Chapter XXII, par 3,
Morals) about disadvantages of evil conduct:

> Monks, there are five disadvantages to one wanting morals, failing in
> morals. What five?
>
> Consider, monks, the man without morals, failing in morals—he comes to
> suffer much loss in wealth through neglect. This, monks, is the first
> disadvantage to one wanting morals, failing in morals.
>
> Or an evil rumour spreads about him. This is the second disadvantage…
>
> Or whatever group he approach, whether nobles or brāhmans,
> householders or recluses, he does so without confidence and confused.
> This is the third disadvantage…
>
> Or he dies muddled (in thought). This is the fourth disadvantage…
>
> Or on the breaking up of the body after death he arises in the wayward
> way, the ill way, the abyss, hell. This is the fifth disadvantage…
>
> Verily, monks, these are the five disadvantages to one wanting morals,
> failing in morals.
>
> (The opposite is said of one perfect in morals.)

The *Visuddhimagga* (I, 154) mentions the following dangers of failure
in virtue:

> …Furthermore, on account of his unvirtuousness an unvirtuous person is
> displeasing to deities and human beings, is uninstructable by his
> fellows in the life of purity, suffers when unvirtuousness is
> censured, and is remorseful when the virtuous are praised…

We then read about many other disadvantages. For example, the unvirtuous
are always nervous, like a man who is everyone’s enemy, he is unfit to
live with and incapable of reaching the distinction of attainment.
Although he imagines that he is happy, yet he is not, since he reaps
suffering.

When we neglect morality we may suffer afterwards from remorse. When we,
for example, give in to slandering we may enjoy it at that moment, but
afterwards remorse may arise and then there is no joy, no peace of mind.
If we abstain from slandering there is no opportunity for remorse. When
we abstain from slandering with kindness and consideration for others
the citta is quite different from the citta which is forgetful of
morality and gives in to slandering. We may be able to learn the
different characteristics of such moments.

When one begins to develop insight one cannot expect to have purity of
morality immediately. We are still full of attachment, aversion and
ignorance, and these unwholesome roots can condition wrong speech, wrong
action and wrong livelihood. Only the sotāpanna has no more conditions
to commit akusala kamma which can lead to an unhappy rebirth. We should
have determination to develop right understanding of whatever reality
appears. When we become angry and utter harsh speech there can be
moments of awareness of nāma and rūpa in between the moments of anger.
Also anger should be known as it is, as only a type of nāma which is
conditioned, not “my anger”, otherwise it can never be eradicated. We
find the unpleasant feeling which accompanies anger very disagreeable
and we may have desire for just calm. Then there is clinging again. Also
the subtle desire for calm should be known as it is. We should consider
what our aim is: only calm, or right understanding of whatever reality
appears. We may think that it is too difficult to develop understanding
of whatever reality appears, we want to delay it when we are tired,
depressed or in an angry mood. However, if there is no beginning of the
development of right understanding, even at those moments we consider
unfavourable, it will always be difficult. If one perseveres in
developing understanding of the present moment, understanding can grow.

One may neglect the precepts because one thinks that they are too
difficult to observe. But if one considers the teachings more often and
starts to develop understanding, there will be more conditions for
remembering what is right and what is wrong in the different situations
of one’s daily life. The aim of the development of right understanding
is the eradication of wrong view, ignorance and all the other
defilements. We cannot be perfect immediately, but we may see the danger
of neglecting morality and the benefit of observing it.

We may not kill or steal, but we may be forgetful as far as our speech
is concerned. A word which can harm ourselves and others is uttered
before we realize it. We tend to disparage others because we are
attached to talking and want to keep the conversation going. When we are
slighted by someone else we are easily inclined to answer back. Our
self-esteem may be hurt and then we want to defend ourselves. Most of
the time we think of ourselves; we want to be honoured and praised. We
forget that it is beneficial to abstain from wrong speech and to speak
with kusala citta. How often in a day do we speak with kusala citta?

The Buddha reminded the monks about right speech. We should remember
what the Buddha said about right speech in the *Parable of the Saw*
(Middle Length Sayings I, no. 21):

> …Monks, when speaking to others you might speak at a right time or at
> a wrong time; monks, when speaking to others you might speak according
> to fact or not according to fact; monks, when speaking to others you
> might speak gently or harshly; monks, when speaking to others you
> might speak about what is connected with the goal or about what is not
> connected with the goal; monks, when speaking to others you might
> speak with a mind of friendliness or full of hatred. Herein, monks,
> you should train yourselves thus: “Neither will our minds become
> perverted nor will we utter an evil speech, but kindly and
> compassionate will we dwell, with a mind of friendliness, void of
> hatred; and we will dwell having suffused that person with a mind of
> friendliness; and, beginning with him, we will dwell having suffused
> the whole world with a mind of friendliness that is far-reaching,
> wide-spread, immeasurable, without enmity, without malevolence.” This
> is how you must train yourselves, monks.

When we give in to wrong speech there is no kindness and consideration
for other people’s welfare. When there is loving kindness there is no
opportunity for wrong speech. We can and should develop loving kindness
in daily life and we should at the same time see the value of observing
morality, otherwise loving kindness cannot be sincere. Many wholesome
qualities have to be developed together with right understanding so that
eventually defilements can be eradicated.

The abstinences which accompany cittas of the sense-sphere, kāmāvacara
cittas, arise only one at a time, but when lokuttara cittas arise, all
three abstinences accompany the lokuttara cittas, and then nibbāna is
the object. Thus, the object of the abstinences which are lokuttara is
different from the object of the abstinences which are of the
sense-sphere. The abstinences which are lokuttara are the right speech,
right action and right livelihood of the supramundane eightfold Path.

We read in the *Atthasālinī* (II, Part VIII, Chapter I, 219, 220) about
the right speech which is lokuttara, that is does not allow the
commission of wrong speech, that it cuts off the base of misconduct and
fulfils the path-factor. The same is said about right action which cuts
off the base of bodily misconduct and fulfils the path-factor, and about
right livelihood which cuts off the base of wrong livelihood and fulfils
the path-factor[(186)](#FOOT186). Thus, in cutting off the conditions
for wrong conduct the three abstinences which are lokuttara fulfil their
functions as path-factors.

Defilements are eradicated subsequently at the different stages of
enlightenment. When the path-consciousness, the magga-citta, of the
sotāpanna arises, the bases of the three kinds of wrong action which are
killing, stealing and sexual misconduct, and of the kind of wrong speech
which is lying and also the base of wrong livelihood are cut off. The
kinds of wrong speech which are slandering, harsh speech and idle talk
have not been eradicated, but they cannot have the intensity anymore of
akusala kamma patha (unwholesome course of action) which can produce an
unhappy rebirth. The sakadāgāmī, the person who has attained the second
stage of enlightenment, has not eradicated these kinds of speech, but at
this stage the tendencies to such speech have decreased. The anāgāmī,
the person who has attained the third stage of enlightenment, has
eradicated the tendency to slandering and harsh speech but not yet the
tendency to idle talk. The tendency to idle talk has only been
eradicated by the arahat. We may not lie, slander or utter harsh speech,
but still, our speech may not be motivated by kusala citta which is
generous and intent on helping others or on explaining the Dhamma to
others. Instead we may indulge in idle, useless talk. We may, for
example, chat with akusala citta about accidents or other events which
happen during the day. However, we can also talk with kusala citta about
events such as accidents; for example, we may talk about an accident in
order to remind ourselves and others of the shortness of life. Idle talk
is done with akusala citta. The monk should train himself to speak only
about subjects which lead to the goal, such as fewness of wishes and
mental development, and he should not indulge in idle talk. A layman
does not lead the monk’s life, but even while one talks about useless
things with akusala citta there can, in between, be moments of awareness
of nāma and rūpa. The arahat has no more conditions for the laylife and
no more tendencies to idle, useless talk.

Summarizing the cittas which can be accompanied by the abstinences, they
are:

- eight mahā-kusala cittas which are of the sense-sphere (kāmāvacara
 kusala cittas)
- eight (or forty) lokuttara cittas which are accompanied by all three
 abstinences

In the case of the mahā-kusala cittas, only one kind of abstinence
arises at a time, as the occasion presents itself; not every mahā-kusala
citta is accompanied by one of the abstinences. The abstinences are not
among the nineteen sobhana cetasikas which accompany each sobhana citta;
they do not accompany vipāka-cittas since they are the actual abstinence
from wrong conduct. Neither do the three abstinences accompany the
mahā-kiriyacittas of the arahat since there are for those who have
eradicated all defilements no more opportunities for abstention.

The three abstinences do not accompany rūpāvacara cittas (fine-material
jhānacittas) and arūpāvacara cittas (immaterial jhānacittas) since there
is no opportunity for abstention when the citta is jhānacitta, the citta
which does not experience sense-impressions.

The three abstinences which together accompany the lokuttara cittas are
the three factors which are the right speech, right action and right
livelihood of the eightfold Path. They accompany the magga-cittas and
they also accompany the phala-cittas (fruition-consciousness). The
phala-cittas are the results of the magga-cittas, but they are different
from other types of vipākacittas. The phala-cittas are lokuttara
vipākacittas experiencing nibbāna, and they immediately succeed the
magga-citta which produces them, in the same process.

Thus, we see that there are many kinds and degrees of the three
abstinences. There is abstinence without right understanding and with
right understanding. When lokuttara citta arises all three abstinences
accompany the lokuttara citta and they are also lokuttara.

### Questions

1. Why can, in the case of cittas of the sense-sphere, only one of the
 three abstinences arise at a time?
2. At which moment do all three abstinences arise together? Which
 function do they have in that case?
3. Can the abstinences accompany mahā-vipākacitta of the sense-sphere?
4. Why can the abstinences not accompany jhānacitta?
5. When is wrong livelihood eradicated?
6. What is idle talk?
7. When we talk about an accident is it always motivated by akusala
 citta?
8. Why is fewness of wishes one of the proximate causes of abstinence
 from wrong conduct?
