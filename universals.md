# Part 1: The Universals

There are seven cetasikas which have to arise with every citta; they are called the “universals” (sabbacitta-sādhāranā). Some cittas are accompanied only by the universals, others are accompanied by several more cetasikas in addition. Thus, every citta is accompanied by at least the seven universals.
